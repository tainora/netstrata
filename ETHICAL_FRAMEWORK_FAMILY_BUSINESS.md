# Ethical Framework for Family-Connected Business Engagement

**Prepared:** 2025-11-03
**Context:** Strategic engagement with Netstrata (Mother's boyfriend = Founder/Chairman)
**Principle:** Integrity first, opportunity second

---

## Executive Summary

The family connection to Netstrata's founder creates a unique opportunity but requires extraordinary ethical rigor to preserve both the business relationship AND the personal relationship. This framework ensures you deliver genuine value while maintaining integrity and avoiding any appearance of nepotism or exploitation.

**Core Principle:** Prove value BEFORE asking for opportunity. Demonstrate capability INDEPENDENT of relationship.

---

## Part 1: Ethical Considerations Analysis

### The Dual Relationship Challenge

**Personal Relationship Dynamics:**

- Mother's boyfriend = strong emotional connection for her
- Your success or failure reflects on your mother
- Chairman wants to help but has fiduciary duty to company
- Poor performance damages TWO relationships (personal + professional)

**Business Relationship Dynamics:**

- Chairman has 2000+ schemes under management
- McGrathNicol review created transparency requirements
- Any perceived nepotism undermines company credibility
- Other employees watching for fairness signals

### Risk Assessment

**Risks to Personal Relationship:**

- Failure/underperformance creates awkwardness at family gatherings
- Mother feels caught in middle if things go wrong
- Chairman feels taken advantage of if you overcharge
- Potential resentment if relationship feels "used"

**Risks to Professional Credibility:**

- Other staff perceive favoritism, undermining team morale
- Your achievements questioned ("only got it because of relationship")
- Chairman's judgment questioned by board/stakeholders
- Industry peers view engagement cynically

**Risks to Company:**

- Overpaying for substandard work
- Distraction from real priorities
- Relationship complications interfering with business decisions
- Reputational risk if engagement appears nepotistic

### The Integrity Test

Ask yourself before EVERY interaction:

1. **Would I get this opportunity without the relationship?**
   - If no: Don't pursue until you've proven independent value
   - If yes: Proceed with normal professional standards

2. **Am I delivering value proportional to compensation?**
   - If no: Reduce scope or price
   - If yes: Document ROI objectively

3. **Would I be comfortable if this was made public?**
   - If no: Restructure the engagement
   - If yes: Proceed with full transparency

4. **Can I walk away gracefully if it's not working?**
   - If no: Don't start
   - If yes: Define exit criteria upfront

---

## Part 2: Value-First Demonstration Strategy

### Principle: Earn the Right to the Conversation

**DO NOT:**

- Lead with the relationship ("Your girlfriend's son wants a job")
- Ask for meeting without demonstrated value
- Pitch vague consulting services
- Expect special consideration

**DO:**

- Build something valuable FIRST
- Share it freely as a gift/demonstration
- Let the work speak for itself
- Position as "thought you might find this useful"

### The Pre-Engagement Demonstration

**Phase 1: Build Without Asking (Weeks 1-2)**

Create a tangible, working demonstration that solves a REAL Netstrata pain point:

**Option A: NSW Strata Hub Automation Tool**

- Build complete proof-of-concept
- Create demo video showing before/after
- Prepare documentation showing time savings
- Package as open-source tool they can evaluate

**Option B: McGrathNicol Compliance Dashboard**

- Build visual tracker for 6 remaining recommendations
- Include deadline alerts and progress tracking
- Create audit-ready report generation
- Show how it prevents July 1, 2025 deadline miss

**Option C: Legislative Update AI Assistant**

- Monitor NSW Fair Trading updates
- Generate sample client-ready blog post
- Demonstrate 24-48 hour response capability
- Compare to current manual process

**Deliverable:** Working software + documentation + demo video

**Investment:** 20-40 hours of your time, ZERO commitment from them

**Positioning:** "I built this because I found the problem interesting. Thought you might find it useful. No strings attached."

### Phase 2: Third-Party Validation (Week 3)

**Avoid direct pitch to Chairman initially.** Instead:

1. **Share with COO (Andrew Tunks) first**
   - He has innovation mandate
   - Less relationship complexity
   - Professional evaluation without personal dynamics
   - If he sees value, HE brings it to Chairman

2. **Email template to COO:**

```
Subject: Free Tool for NSW Strata Hub Automation (No Strings Attached)

Hi Andrew,

I'm a software engineer specializing in AI-powered compliance automation.
I've been following Netstrata's technology investments (virtual meetings,
Owners Portal, etc.) and was intrigued by the operational challenges in
strata management.

I built a proof-of-concept tool that automates NSW Strata Hub annual
reporting—reducing data entry from hours to minutes per scheme. I'm
sharing it freely because I think it might be useful for your 2000+ schemes.

Demo video: [link]
Source code: [GitHub link]
Documentation: [link]

No pitch, no ask. Just thought you might find it valuable given your focus
on operational efficiency and innovation.

If you find it useful and want to discuss enhancements or other automation
opportunities, happy to chat. If not, no worries—it was a fun project.

Best regards,
Terry Li

P.S. Full disclosure: I know Stephen through family connections, but I
wanted to reach out to you directly since this relates to operational
efficiency in your domain. I prefer to earn any opportunity through
demonstrated value rather than personal relationships.
```

**Why this works:**

- Demonstrates capability without asking for anything
- Third-party professional evaluation
- Addresses relationship transparently
- Low-pressure, high-value approach
- COO can reject without personal awkwardness

### Phase 3: Natural Progression (Week 4+)

**If COO sees value:**

- He may bring to Chairman naturally
- You've proven capability independently
- Relationship becomes asset, not liability
- Chairman proud to introduce you ("look what Terry built")

**If COO doesn't respond:**

- You've lost 40 hours, not your mother's relationship
- You have portfolio piece for other opportunities
- No awkward family dynamics
- Option to try different approach later

---

## Part 3: Appropriate Engagement Structure

### Pilot Program Design: Low Risk, High Accountability

**Proposed Structure:**

**Phase 1: Proof-of-Concept (4 weeks, Fixed Price)**

**Scope:** Deliver 2 specific tools from your research:

1. McGrathNicol compliance tracker
2. NSW Strata Hub automation tool

**Compensation:** $8,000-$12,000 (market rate for 80-120 hours)

- Junior contractor: $40-50/hr
- This is BELOW market for specialized AI work
- Deliberately conservative to avoid overcharging family

**Success Criteria (Objective, Measurable):**

1. McGrathNicol tracker deployed and in use by 3 managers
2. NSW Hub automation reduces data entry time by 75%+
3. Zero compliance errors in automated processes
4. Positive feedback from 2+ strata managers using tools

**Deliverables:**

- Working software with source code
- Documentation and training materials
- 30-day support period
- Handover to internal team or sunset plan

**Exit Criteria (Defined Upfront):**

- If any success criterion not met: Payment reduced proportionally
- If fundamental approach isn't working: Stop after 2 weeks, pay 50%
- If relationship dynamics become uncomfortable: Exit immediately, keep payment

**Phase 2: Expanded Engagement (3 months, Performance-Based)**

**ONLY proceed if Phase 1 succeeds objectively**

**Scope:** Deliver 3-4 additional automation projects

- Electronic document classification
- Insurance premium predictor
- Crisis communication templates
- Electronic voting platform (select based on business priority)

**Compensation Structure (Hybrid):**

- Base: $5,000/month retainer (20 hours/month minimum)
- Performance bonus: 10% of documented cost savings (capped at $5K/month)
- Example: If tool saves 100 hours @ $50/hr = $5,000 saved = $500 bonus

**Success Metrics:**

- Quantified time savings (hours saved × hourly cost)
- Compliance risk reduction (penalties avoided)
- User satisfaction scores from strata managers
- Adoption rates across portfolio

**Quarterly Review:**

- Present ROI dashboard to Chairman/COO/CFO
- Compare actual savings to projected savings
- Adjust scope/compensation based on results
- Go/no-go decision for next quarter

**Phase 3: Full-Time Role (If Mutual Fit)**

**Only after 6+ months of demonstrated value**

**Position:** Head of Technical Innovation / Automation Engineering Lead

**Compensation:**

- Market rate for role (research industry standards)
- NOT inflated due to relationship
- Performance-based bonuses tied to measurable ROI
- Equity/profit share if appropriate to company structure

**Accountability:**

- Reports to COO (not Chairman) to avoid perception issues
- Annual performance review by third-party consultant
- Success metrics tied to operational efficiency gains
- 360-degree feedback from team

---

## Part 4: Compensation Philosophy

### Pricing Principles: Fair But Not Exploitative

**The Family Discount Paradox:**

- Charging too little = looks like charity, undermines credibility
- Charging too much = exploiting relationship, damages trust
- Sweet spot: Market rate OR BELOW for pilot, market rate for ongoing

**Market Rate Research (Sydney Tech Market 2025):**

- Junior Python developer: $70K-90K salary ($35-45/hr equivalent)
- Mid-level ML engineer: $100K-130K salary ($50-65/hr equivalent)
- Senior automation consultant: $150-200/hr contract rate
- AI specialist consultant: $200-300/hr contract rate

**Your Positioning:**

- Specialized skills (Claude Code CLI, AI integration) = senior level
- Limited experience in strata industry = junior/mid adjustment
- Family connection = conservative discount on pilot
- Proven value = full market rate for ongoing work

**Recommended Pricing:**

**Pilot Phase:**

- Hourly equivalent: $40-50/hr (30% below market for specialized AI work)
- Fixed price preferred to reduce cost risk for them
- Total: $8,000-12,000 for 4-week project (160-240 hours estimated)

**Expanded Engagement:**

- Hourly equivalent: $60-75/hr (market rate for mid-senior)
- Performance bonuses add upside aligned with their ROI
- Cap bonuses to avoid windfall perception

**Full-Time Role:**

- Salary: $110K-140K (market rate for Head of Innovation in strata)
- NOT $150K+ which would be above market and suspicious
- Bonus structure: 10-20% based on quantified operational savings

### The Transparency Test

**Share pricing rationale openly:**

"I've researched market rates for AI automation consultants in Sydney. The
typical range is $150-300/hr. For the pilot, I'm proposing $40-50/hr
equivalent ($8-12K fixed price) because:

1. This is my first project in strata management (learning curve)
2. I want to prove value before asking for full market rate
3. The family connection means I'm extra motivated to deliver value, not maximize fees
4. If this delivers the projected ROI, we can discuss market-rate compensation for future work

I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver than the reverse."

**Why this works:**

- Demonstrates you've done homework
- Acknowledges relationship openly
- Conservative pricing builds trust
- Creates upside if you exceed expectations

---

## Part 5: Success Metrics and Accountability

### Quantifying Value: The ROI Dashboard

**Problem:** Vague consulting is relationship poison
**Solution:** Ruthlessly objective success measurement

**Create Monthly ROI Report:**

**Template Structure:**

TOTAL MONTHLY VALUE:
- Investment: $3,000 (retainer) + $500 (bonus) = $3,500
- Documented savings: $14,150
- ROI: 404% (4x return on investment)
- Cumulative 6-month savings: $78,000

QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK:
- "The compliance tracker saved us during the McGrathNicol audit" - Manager A
- "NSW Hub automation cut our annual reporting time by 80%" - Manager B

CHALLENGES & MITIGATIONS:
- Integration with legacy system required 20 extra hours (absorbed, not billed)
- Training materials needed improvement (revised based on feedback)

NEXT MONTH PRIORITIES:
- Deploy electronic document classifier to 3 pilot schemes
- Integrate insurance premium predictor with existing data
- Train 5 additional staff on automation tools
```

**Delivery:** Email to Chairman, COO, CFO monthly
**Transparency:** Shows both successes AND challenges
**Accountability:** Tied to objective, verifiable metrics

### The Third-Party Audit Option

**After 6 months, propose independent evaluation:**

"I want to ensure I'm delivering genuine value, not just getting opportunities
because of our relationship. Would you be open to having an independent
consultant audit my work and ROI claims? I'll pay for half the cost.

This would:

1. Validate my ROI calculations objectively
2. Give you confidence in the value proposition
3. Identify areas where I can improve
4. Demonstrate I'm committed to accountability, not access"

**Why this works:**

- Shows you're not afraid of scrutiny
- Builds trust through voluntary transparency
- Protects Chairman from perception issues
- Demonstrates professional maturity

---

## Part 6: Exit and Failure Planning

### Preserving Relationships When Business Doesn't Work

**The Hard Truth:** Most pilot projects fail or underperform. Planning for this is ESSENTIAL.

### Exit Trigger Criteria (Define Upfront)

**Red Flags to Stop Immediately:**

1. **You're not delivering value**
   - ROI consistently below projections
   - User feedback is negative
   - Tools not being adopted
   - Action: Stop project, refund proportional payment, apologize

2. **The relationship is becoming strained**
   - Awkward family gatherings
   - Chairman avoiding you
   - Mother expressing concern
   - Action: Exit gracefully, keep payment, suggest break

3. **Company priorities have shifted**
   - Budget cuts
   - Different strategic direction
   - Technology freeze
   - Action: Pause project, offer to resume when timing better

4. **You're being treated differently due to relationship**
   - Avoiding hard feedback
   - Can't have honest conversations
   - Perception of favoritism from others
   - Action: Suggest reporting to different manager or exit

### The Exit Conversation Script

**If you need to exit:**

"Stephen, I want to talk about the [project name] engagement. After [X weeks/months],
I don't think I'm delivering the value I promised:

[Specific examples of underperformance]

The professional thing to do is to wrap up the project now rather than
continue hoping it will improve. Here's what I propose:

1. I'll complete [specific deliverable] by [date]
2. I'll refund [amount] since I didn't meet [metric]
3. I'll document everything so internal team can maintain it
4. We can revisit this in 6 months if circumstances change

Most importantly: I don't want this to affect our personal relationship.
I tried something, it didn't work out, and I'm taking responsibility for that.

I hope we can keep the relationship separate from the business outcome."

**Why this works:**

- Takes full responsibility
- Specific and professional
- Preserves personal relationship explicitly
- Offers financial accountability (refund)
- Leaves door open without pressure

### The "Not Right Now" Alternative

**If timing is wrong but not capability:**

"I think the [tool/project] has real potential, but I don't think now is the
right time because [legitimate reason: budget, priorities, resources].

Rather than force it, why don't we:

1. Pause the project for 3-6 months
2. I'll open-source what I've built so far
3. If circumstances change and you want to revisit, I'm available
4. If not, no hard feelings—the exploration was valuable for me

Let's keep the personal relationship separate from business timing."

**Why this works:**

- Acknowledges external factors (not personal failure)
- Removes pressure and awkwardness
- Preserves option value without commitment
- Explicitly protects personal relationship

### The Post-Exit Relationship Maintenance

**After exiting project:**

1. **Continue normal family interactions**
   - Don't avoid gatherings
   - Don't bring up the project unless asked
   - Show the business outcome doesn't change personal respect

2. **Send periodic value-adds (no strings)**
   - Article relevant to strata management
   - Introduction to useful contact
   - Insight from different project
   - Shows you care about their success, not just your opportunity

3. **Wait 12+ months before any re-engagement**
   - Let the air clear completely
   - Build other portfolio projects
   - Demonstrate you don't need the relationship

---

## Part 7: Relationship Preservation Strategies

### Separating Business and Personal

**Golden Rules:**

1. **Never discuss business at family gatherings**
   - No project updates at dinner
   - No pitches at birthdays
   - No shop talk unless Chairman initiates

2. **Create professional boundaries**
   - Use work email, not personal
   - Schedule formal meetings, not casual chats
   - Treat him as "Stephen the Chairman" not "Mom's boyfriend"

3. **Protect your mother from middle-man role**
   - Never ask her to pass messages
   - Never complain to her about the engagement
   - Never make her feel she needs to advocate for you

4. **Communicate failures proactively**
   - Don't let him discover problems
   - Don't make excuses
   - Don't blame circumstances
   - Take responsibility immediately

### The "Business Failure ≠ Personal Failure" Mindset

**Frame the engagement as experiment, not entitlement:**

"I'm trying something new (automation in strata management). It might work,
it might not. If it doesn't work, that's a normal business outcome—most
pilots don't scale. I want you to feel comfortable giving me honest feedback
and pulling the plug if it's not working. The business outcome won't change
how I feel about you personally or affect our family relationship."

**Say this explicitly at the START of the engagement.**

**Why this works:**

- Sets expectations that failure is possible
- Gives permission to be honest about problems
- Reduces pressure on both sides
- Protects personal relationship proactively

### Managing Perception with Other Stakeholders

**Be transparent with Netstrata team:**

"Yes, I know Stephen through family connections. That's why I'm being extra
careful to prove value objectively through measurable ROI. I welcome your
feedback and scrutiny—I want to earn your respect through results, not
connections."

**With your mother:**

"I'm working on a project with Stephen's company. I want to be clear that
I'm treating this as a professional engagement with high standards. If it
works out, great. If it doesn't, that won't affect our family relationship.
Please don't feel you need to be involved or advocate for me."

**With industry peers:**

"I'm doing some automation work for Netstrata. Yes, I have a family connection
to the founder, which is why I'm being extra rigorous about proving ROI and
keeping the engagement at or below market rates. I'm happy to show you my
success metrics if you're curious about the approach."

---

## Part 8: The Conversation Approach

### Initial Conversation with Chairman (If Direct Route)

**Timing:** Only AFTER building demonstration project (Phase 1 complete)

**Setting:** Professional environment (coffee shop, office, NOT family gathering)

**Opening:**

"Stephen, I wanted to talk to you in your capacity as Netstrata's Chairman,
not as [Mom's name]'s boyfriend. I've been working on something I think
might be valuable for Netstrata, and I want your professional opinion.

Before I show you what I've built, I want to acknowledge the awkwardness of
this conversation. I know you care about me personally, and I care about you.
But I also know you have a fiduciary responsibility to Netstrata and can't
make decisions based on personal relationships.

So I want to be very clear about my intentions and how I'm thinking about this:

1. I built something valuable FIRST, without asking for anything
2. I want you to evaluate it purely on merit, not relationship
3. If it's not useful, I want you to tell me honestly—no hard feelings
4. If it IS useful, I'd like to discuss how I might help further, but only
   if the value proposition makes business sense
5. Most importantly: Whether this works out or not, it won't change our
   personal relationship

Can I show you what I built and get your professional feedback?"

**The Demonstration:**

[Show the working tool, demo video, documentation]

**The Ask:**

"If you think this has value, I'd like to propose a low-risk pilot program:

- 4 weeks, fixed price ($8-12K)
- Two specific deliverables: [X] and [Y]
- Objective success criteria: [measurable metrics]
- Exit clause: If it's not working after 2 weeks, we stop and you pay 50%
- ROI target: 3-5x return on your investment

I've deliberately priced this conservatively because I want to prove value
before asking for full market rates. I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver.

If the pilot succeeds based on the objective metrics, we can discuss expanding
the engagement. If it doesn't, no hard feelings—it was worth trying.

What do you think? And please be brutally honest—I can handle rejection, and
I'd rather you tell me if this isn't right for Netstrata."

**Why this works:**

- Acknowledges awkwardness directly
- Demonstrates you've built something already
- Shows respect for his position and responsibilities
- Provides low-risk entry point
- Gives explicit permission to say no
- Protects personal relationship proactively

### Alternative: The COO-First Approach (Recommended)

**As outlined in Part 2, this is BETTER because:**

1. Less emotionally complex (no family relationship)
2. Professional evaluation by innovation-focused executive
3. Chairman learns about your work FROM his team (powerful endorsement)
4. If COO says no, no family awkwardness
5. If COO says yes, Chairman proud rather than pressured

**Email to COO (Andrew Tunks):**

[See Part 2 for full email template]

**Follow-up IF COO expresses interest:**

"Thanks for the positive feedback on the automation tool. Before we discuss
next steps, I should mention that I know Stephen (Chairman) through family
connections—he's dating my mother.

I intentionally reached out to you first rather than him because I wanted
the work to be evaluated on merit, not relationship. I'm happy to discuss
this further with you and the team, and if it makes sense to involve Stephen
at some point, that's fine.

I just wanted to be transparent about the connection upfront. I'm committed
to proving value objectively through measurable ROI, regardless of any
personal relationships."

**Why this works:**

- Discloses relationship after interest expressed
- Shows you're not hiding anything
- Explains why you approached COO first
- Demonstrates commitment to merit-based evaluation

## Part 10: Final Recommendations

### The Integrity-First Approach

**Recommended Path:**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Build NSW Strata Hub automation tool (gift, no ask)
2. **Week 3:** Email COO with free tool and demo (third-party evaluation)
3. **Week 4:** If COO responds positively, disclose family connection
4. **Week 5-6:** Present pilot proposal through COO to leadership team
5. **Weeks 7-10:** Execute pilot with ruthless accountability
6. **Week 11:** Present ROI analysis and go/no-go decision

**Alternative If Direct Approach:**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Build demonstration project
2. **Week 3:** Schedule professional meeting with Chairman
3. **Week 3:** Have "the conversation" (use script from Part 8)
4. **Weeks 4-7:** Execute pilot if greenlit
5. **Week 8:** ROI analysis and next steps

### The Conversation Summary

**Key phrases to use:**

- "I want to prove value BEFORE asking for opportunity"
- "I've built this already—it's yours regardless of whether we work together"
- "Please evaluate this purely on business merit, not our personal relationship"
- "I've deliberately priced conservatively because I want to earn the right to market rates"
- "If this doesn't work out, it won't affect our personal relationship"
- "I welcome your brutal honesty—I can handle rejection"
- "I'd rather under-promise and over-deliver than the reverse"

**Key behaviors to demonstrate:**

- Built something valuable FIRST (not just ideas)
- Quantified ROI with objective metrics
- Priced conservatively (at or below market)
- Defined exit criteria upfront
- Gave explicit permission to say no
- Acknowledged relationship complexity openly
- Separated business and personal relationships

### Success Definition

**This engagement is successful if:**

1. You deliver measurable value (3-5x ROI minimum)
2. The personal relationship is preserved or strengthened
3. You're respected for competence, not connections
4. Netstrata team sees you as asset, not nepotism case
5. Chairman proud to have you involved (not embarrassed)
6. Mother never feels caught in the middle
7. You build portfolio valuable beyond this relationship

**This engagement is UNSUCCESSFUL if:**

1. You deliver poor value or overcharge
2. Personal relationship becomes strained or awkward
3. You're seen as "chairman's girlfriend's son" not professional
4. Netstrata team resents your presence
5. Chairman regrets getting involved
6. Mother feels uncomfortable about the situation
7. You become dependent on this relationship for opportunities

### The North Star Principle

**Every decision should pass this test:**

> "If this engagement and its terms were made public on the front page of
> the Sydney Morning Herald, would I be proud of how I handled it?"

If yes: Proceed.
If no: Restructure.

**Remember:** The opportunity is worthless if it costs you integrity, family relationships, or self-respect.

### Script 2: Initial Meeting with Chairman

[See Part 8 for full conversation outline]

### Script 3: Disclosing Family Connection (After Interest)

"Before we proceed, I should mention that I have a personal connection to
Stephen—he's dating my mother. I intentionally didn't lead with this because
I wanted the work to be evaluated on merit first.

I'm committed to proving value through objective ROI metrics, and I've priced
the engagement conservatively to ensure I'm not overcharging due to the
relationship. I'm happy to discuss how to handle this appropriately—perhaps
having me report to you rather than Stephen directly, or including third-party
audits of my work.

The most important thing to me is maintaining integrity and delivering genuine
value, not leveraging personal relationships."

## Document Control

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-11-03
**Author:** Terry Li
**Status:** Living document—update as situation evolves

**Review Schedule:**

- Before initial outreach
- After first conversation

- Quarterly during ongoing engagement

**Final Thought:**

The family connection is simultaneously your biggest opportunity and biggest risk. Handle it with extraordinary integrity, and it becomes a strength. Handle it carelessly, and it damages two relationships you care about.

When in doubt, ask yourself: "Am I treating this opportunity with more care or less care because of the relationship?" The answer should always be MORE care.

Good luck. Do the right thing.
