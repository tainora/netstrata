## Key Learnings from November 30 Call

**Corrections Applied to Docs 01, 02, 04**:

1. **Timeline**: December 2025 and July 2026 milestones (not vague "end-2026")
2. **Richardson**: Stable adoption, "happy with what they've got" (not urgent blocker)
3. **AI positioning**: Development tooling only (Epi leads business automation)
4. **Names**: Tom Bacani, Epi Neto (spellings corrected)

**Ted's Key Quotes**:

- Richardson: "They've had a bit of indigestion with it"
- Tom's availability: "Very, very busy time for them"
- AI skepticism: Board report "50% was just garbage"

## Technical Context

**Strata Space Development**:

- $12-14M invested over ~15 years
- December 2025: DMS, Tasks, Time Recording ("biggest operational shift since Financials")
- July 2026: Buildings, Asset Management, Dashboard (90-95% coverage)
- 3 squads working in parallel (Manila-based team)

**AI at Netstrata** (Epi Neto's domain):

- Knowledge bot (pilot Jan 2026)
- Fire asset quote pricing
- Meeting minutes extraction

**My AI contribution** (non-overlapping):

- Development tooling (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Production automation workflows
- AI-first development velocity

---

## Working Guidelines

- **Build prototypes**, not slide decks
- **Focus on measurable outcomes** (time saved, costs reduced)
- **No AI hype** (Ted skeptical after board report disaster)
- **Demonstrate value** through December 2025 milestone support
