**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2025-11-03
**Purpose**: Strategic advisory opportunity research for Netstrata strata management company

---

## Project Context

### Personal Connection

**Ted Middleton** (Netstrata founder and Chairman of the Board) is the user's mother's boyfriend and like family. This creates a unique opportunity to leverage AI/automation expertise to help his company stay ahead of competition and become future-proof.

**Critical Note**: Ted Middleton is the founder, not Stephen Brell (who is Managing Director).

### Strategic Objective

Position user as **Strategic Technology Advisor** to help Netstrata navigate:

- McGrathNicol review aftermath (16/22 recommendations completed by May 2025)
- 2025 NSW law reforms requiring enhanced transparency
- 20%+ annual insurance premium increases
- Operational scaling across 2000+ schemes
- PropTech disruption threats

### Ethical Framework

This is NOT a job application. It's a family-connected advisory opportunity requiring:

- Integrity-first approach
- Objective value delivery
- No hype or overselling
- Focus on business fundamentals over relationship leverage

## Working Guidelines

### Research Priorities

1. **McGrathNicol follow-up**: What happened after July 1, 2025 deadline?
2. **Competitive landscape**: PropTech threats (Strata Manager, :Different, Strata Master)
