# Netstrata Strategic Research Project

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2025-11-03
**Purpose**: Strategic advisory opportunity research for Netstrata strata management company

---

## Project Context

### Personal Connection

**Ted Middleton** (Netstrata founder and Chairman of the Board) is the user's mother's boyfriend and like family. This creates a unique opportunity to leverage AI/automation expertise to help his company stay ahead of competition and become future-proof.

**Critical Note**: Ted Middleton is the founder, not Stephen Brell (who is Managing Director).

### Strategic Objective

**UPDATED (2025-11-04)**: Exploring employment opportunity at Netstrata to contribute to:

- Proprietary software completion (expected end 2026, $12-14M invested)
- External software rollout strategy (Western Australia test case pending)
- AI/automation integration with practical business value
- Core business operations across multiple divisions

Previous research focus: Strategic Technology Advisor positioning for compliance/automation challenges

### Ethical Framework

Employment opportunity with family connection requiring:

- Capability-first approach (not relationship leverage)
- Objective value delivery
- No hype or overselling
- Focus on business fundamentals and practical results
- Address obstacles directly (work visa, age/timeline, relocation)

## Key Findings

### Proprietary Software Development (NEW - from Ted conversation)

- **Investment**: $12-14M over ~10 years (2006-2025)
- **Timeline**: Expected completion end of 2026
- **Current State**: "Fully functional" - running in tandem with legacy system
- **Major Milestone**: 2024 - "very expensive and very disruptive" change, began capitalizing costs
- **History**:
  - 2006-2011: External contractor (ran out of money)
  - 2011: Hostile takeover - acquired software company
  - 2015-2016: Complete rebuild decision (cloud-based)
  - 2025: Operational but not ready for external customers
- **Competitive Advantage**: Only software written by practitioners (not external vendors)
- **Market Strategy**: Give away cut-down version (with strings) to non-NSW competitors
- **First External User**: Western Australia company waiting to migrate from old Netstrata software

### Technology Readiness

- Heavy investment in digital infrastructure (virtual meetings, financial portals, Zoom phone system)
- Recent office migration: Junked all servers, full cloud migration
- COO Andrew Tunks mandate: "operational efficiency, continuous improvement, innovation"
- Culture receptive to technical innovation but skeptical of AI hype

### Urgent Compliance Pressures

- McGrathNicol deadline: July 1, 2025 (6 remaining recommendations) - **NOW PAST**
- NSW law reforms: 2025 legislative changes (penalties up to $110K)
- Electronic records mandate: June 2024 requirement
- Fire safety compliance: AS1851-2012 standard (Feb 2025)

### Automation Opportunities

- **NSW Strata Hub bulk upload**: 2000+ schemes × 30 fields annually (manual)
- **Legislative update translation**: 159 blog posts about law changes (manual research)
- **Document classification**: Electronic records mandate requires automation
- **Insurance risk prediction**: No early warning system for 20%+ premium increases
- **Predictive maintenance**: 22% of complaints are repairs (reactive approach)

### Total Potential Value

**$10-15M annual ROI** through automation, compliance excellence, and risk management intelligence

## Working Guidelines

### Research Priorities

1. **McGrathNicol follow-up**: What happened after July 1, 2025 deadline?
2. **Competitive landscape**: PropTech threats (Strata Manager, :Different, Strata Master)

**Next Action**: Send materials to Ted this week (before November 11)
**Ted's Availability**: Limited until post-AGM (after November 27, 2025)

---

## Notes

### Opportunity Type (UPDATED)

- **Employment opportunity** (not advisory contract) with family connection
- Ted is open: "I'm happy to do what I can for you"
- Mutual benefit approach: "You can help out our company and we can use your skills"
- Process: Materials → Cheryl Williams (HR) → Formal assessment

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Work Visa**: Research Australian sponsorship requirements for specialized IT/software roles
2. **Capability Demonstration**: Show practical value, not AI hype (Ted skeptical of AI)
3. **Software Completion Focus**: Align with end-2026 completion timeline
4. **Business Fundamentals**: Industry "not sophisticated" - focus on efficiency, not marketability
5. **Cultural Fit**: "More about capability of people... nothing else"

### Ted's Software Vision

- "One of our most valuable assets... will be our software" ($12-14M invested)
- Competitive advantage: "Only software written by people who do the work"
- Not for local NSW market: "Don't want to share with competitors"
- Western Australia test case pending when ready

### Key Contacts for Follow-up

1. **Cheryl Williams** (HR Manager) - first formal discussion
2. **Tom Bakani** (Software Operations) - technical stakeholder
3. **Epi Mito** (IT Infrastructure) - technical stakeholder
4. **Andrew Tunks** (COO) - operational decision maker
