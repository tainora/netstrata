Subject: Automating NSW Strata Hub Compliance for Your 2000+ Schemes

Hi Andrew,

Congratulations on your appointment as COO at Netstrata. I read about your mandate
to strengthen operational efficiency and support innovation, and I wanted to reach out.

I noticed Netstrata has invested heavily in digital infrastructure (virtual meetings,
Owners Portal, Macquarie integration), but your blog on NSW Strata Hub reporting
suggests bulk upload automation is still manual across your 2000+ schemes.

I'm a Claude Code CLI expert specializing in AI-powered compliance automation.
I've built a proof-of-concept that automates NSW Strata Hub annual reporting—
reducing data entry from hours to minutes while ensuring 100% compliance.

I've also identified opportunities to support your July 1, 2025 McGrathNicol
compliance deadline through automated tracking and attestation workflows.

Would you have 30 minutes next week to discuss how automation could support
your operational efficiency goals?

Best regards,
Terry Li

P.S. I analyzed your 292 blog posts to understand Netstrata's challenges.
Happy to share insights on automation opportunities I discovered.
