Sydney Wharf has been named Australia’s best residential development at the fourth annual Property Council of Australia Rider Levett Bucknall Innovation and Excellence Awards. The luxury residential and marina complex was honoured tonight with the Netstrata award for residential development at the gala award dinner at Star City in Sydney. Property Council of Australia CEO Peter Verwer said the development, completed by Charter Hall, AMP Capital Investors and Babcock and Brown, represents a significant milestone in the Pyrmont urban renewal vision.
“The redevelopment of Sydney Wharf has seen not only a physical transformation, but also a reversal of the closed, privatised nature of the site’s former maritime use,” Mr Verwer said.
“Sydney Wharf now provides residents, visitors and the wider community with access to this picturesque harbourside location. Sydney Wharf has achieved something extraordinary.”
The conversion of this site has seen the construction of 104 luxury apartments over two buildings, ringed by over one hectare of publicly accessible timber boardwalks and urban parkland. This is complemented by a 54 berth marina which provides direct water access to Sydney’s sparkling harbour.
Mr Stephen Mee, Director of Rider Levett Bucknall Sydney said Sydney Wharf has delivered exceptional urban outcomes for the local community.
“The general public is now able to enjoy the spectacular city and harbour views offered from the site as they stroll around the perimeter boardwalks which complete the Pyrmont to Darling Harbour foreshore link,” Mr Mee said.
