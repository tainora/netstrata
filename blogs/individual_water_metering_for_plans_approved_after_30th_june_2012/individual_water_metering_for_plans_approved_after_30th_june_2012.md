Sydney Water will make individual water metering for multiple dwelling buildings a requirement for the issue of a compliance certificate under s73 of the Sydney Water Act for all applications received after 30 June 2012.

Metering specifications will require:

- Individual supply point to each unit.
- Provision of a space for the meter installation.
- Installation of the meter in a cupboard in a common area with a drain.
- Provision of space for a data logger/transmitter and 240V power.

Sydney Water intends to nominate at least two accredited suppliers for the new metering.

Sydney Water may take a flexible approach to plans which have been lodged with council prior to 1 July 2012 but which do not come before it prior to that date.
