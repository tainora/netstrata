    "main_content": "Sydney Water will make individual water metering for multiple dwelling buildings a requirement for the issue of a compliance certificate under s73 of the Sydney Water Act for all applications received after 30 June 2012.\n\nMetering specifications will require:\n\n- Individual supply point to each unit.\n- Provision of a space for the meter installation.\n- Installation of the meter in a cupboard in a common area with a drain.\n- Provision of space for a data logger/transmitter and 240V power.\n\nSydney Water intends to nominate at least two accredited suppliers for the new metering.\n\nSydney Water may take a flexible approach to plans which have been lodged with council prior to 1 July 2012 but which do not come before it prior to that date.\n\nThank you J.S Mueller & Co Lawyer for this article",
