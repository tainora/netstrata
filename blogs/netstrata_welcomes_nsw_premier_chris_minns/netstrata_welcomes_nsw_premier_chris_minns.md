We were honoured to welcome NSW Premier Chris Minns to Netstrata.

The Premier’s visit was a great opportunity to showcase the work our team does every day to support strata communities across New South Wales. We discussed the important role strata plays in shaping the places people live, work and invest in, and the contribution it makes to the state’s housing future.

At Netstrata, we’re committed to delivering proactive, transparent and client-focused strata management. Having the Premier take the time to engage with us and understand the challenges and opportunities in our industry reinforces the importance of the sector in the broader community.

We look forward to continuing to work alongside government, developers and owners to create sustainable and well-managed communities.
