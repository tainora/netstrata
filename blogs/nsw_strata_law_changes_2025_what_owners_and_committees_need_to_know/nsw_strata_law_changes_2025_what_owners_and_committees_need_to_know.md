From 27 October 2025, new NSW strata law changes will come into effect. These reforms aim to improve fairness, transparency, and accountability in strata living.

At Netstrata, we’ve summarised the key changes and what they mean for owners corporations, strata committees, developers and managers.

### Key NSW Strata Law Changes from 27 October 2025

1. Clearer Building Manager Definitions
   The reforms clarify who is not a building manager and set new duties for those who are. Building managers must act in the best interests of the scheme and meet higher standards around maintenance, safety and disclosure.

2. Stronger Transparency and Disclosure

- Building manager candidates must declare any financial benefits that influence fees.
- Strata levy notices must include a Financial Hardship Information Statement to better support owners under financial stress.

3. More Power for Owners and the Tribunal
   Owners corporations will have new grounds to apply to the Tribunal to change or end strata management and building management agreements if they are unfair or not performing.

4. New Financial Hardship Protections
   Payment plans for overdue strata levies must use standard, approved forms. Owners will also have clearer guidance on hardship options.

5. Enhanced Compliance Oversight
   NSW Fair Trading will gain stronger powers to investigate and enforce strata scheme compliance.

### Upcoming Strata Law Changes from 1 April 2026

Further reforms start on 1 April 2026, including:

- Standardised forms for 10-year capital works fund plans
- Initial Maintenance Schedules (IMS) at developer handover using approved forms
- Independent surveyor certification of IMS and levy estimates in multi-storey schemes
- Certified documents to be provided by developers before the first AGM
- Greater disclosure of embedded supply arrangements in strata information certificates

### What These Changes Mean for You

- Developers: More obligations for disclosure, certification and handover.
- Strata & Building Managers: Stricter disclosure requirements and scrutiny of management agreements.
- Strata Committees: Greater power to challenge agreements, plus new responsibilities for levy notices and hardship processes.
- Lot Owners: Better access to hardship information and improved transparency around management fees.

### Preparing for the 2025 Strata Law Reforms

With the October 2025 deadline approaching, strata communities should:

Review strata and building management agreements.
Update levy notice and payment plan templates.
Train committees and managers on new requirements.
Engage surveyors and legal advisors early for April 2026 obligations.
