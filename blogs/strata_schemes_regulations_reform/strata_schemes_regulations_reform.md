Managing Director Stephen Brell has been appointed to the Urban Development Institute of Australia’s Strata & Community Title Committee. Stephen will be involved with reviewing the current Strata Schemes Management Regulations and will be preparing some recommendations to be submitted to the NSW Government for consideration. Stephen said “I am pleased to be part of this committee, as there are a lot of opportunities to enhance the current regulations resulting in greater options for strata schemes”.
