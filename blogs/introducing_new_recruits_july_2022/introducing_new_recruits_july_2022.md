It is with pleasure that we introduce our newest recruits and welcome them to Netstrata! Joining our successful team of Strata Managers, the team are learning from the best in delivering exceptional service to our clients.

The team includes Charles Wong, Ross Whittaker, Amelia Van Der Meer, Cody Munn, Adam Tyrell, Tracey Lovie and Dominic Bayndrian.

Netstrata was established in Sydney in 1996 and is one of the largest organically grown strata management companies in NSW. The secret to our success is the dedication to our staff, offering them a strong foundation to excel in their career. We do this by having our very own Learning & Development division, run by Senior Strata Manager now Director, Andrew Tunks.

We add value to the service we offer our clients by providing you with a strata management team that is fully qualified, with most of the team holding a Strata Agent Licence.  This means that our team offers you the most high-quality and up to date industry knowledge to service you and your scheme at the highest level. Each manager is fully qualified in communication, meetings, interpreting strata documents, maintaining property & facilities, managing finances and record management.

Feel free to pop into our offices in Sydney & Wollongong and meet our newest team members!
