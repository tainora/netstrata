The group met with Schindler and discussed the development of a tailored strata contract that could be offered to the sector to meet the specific needs that have arisen over the years.\n\nJeremy Stone said “Lifts are often one of the most expensive common property items within a strata schemes annual budget, and a clearer contract will result in owners having a better understanding as to what is involved in an annual maintenance program and more flexibility in their decision making process”.",
