It really shows what a friendly, supportive and charitable team we have – we truly are a lucky bunch.\n\nCollectively, we have come SO far. Since the first gathering in 1911, well over a century now, let’s hope to see equality and safety for women across the world and truly make a positive difference!\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
