In celebration of International Women’s Day, Sunday 8th March, we celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women across the world.

Netstrata is at the forefront of valuable and successful women who we are lucky to call our friends and colleagues, and some of whom have been here for 10, 15 and 20 years! It really shows what a friendly, supportive and charitable team we have – we truly are a lucky bunch.

Collectively, we have come SO far. Since the first gathering in 1911, well over a century now, let’s hope to see equality and safety for women across the world and truly make a positive difference!
