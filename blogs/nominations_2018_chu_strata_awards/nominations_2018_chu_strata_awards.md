Nominations for the 2018 CHU Strata Community Awards are now open. These awards, which are eligible to all strata schemes in NSW, recognise outstanding businesses and individuals whose passion, determination and success inspires others.

As the Awards Information Kit says, “Each and every organisation, individual and committee within the strata community is unique but are all striving to reach the same goal – excellence.”

“Excellence is a journey and not a destination. To help with this journey the 2018 CHU Strata Community Awards provides a means of measuring and benchmarking within our industry in NSW.”

There are nine categories of recognition. The Environmental and Engagement Award recognises schemes that focus on reducing their impact on the environment through sustainability initiatives and the Excellence in Innovation Award acknowledges businesses that have made a significant contribution to their industry.

There’s also a category for small (less than 200 lots under management) and large (over 200 lots under management) Strata Community Management businesses. And the Strata Services Business award recognises a company that attained impressive growth over the past 12 months.

The individual award categories feature Strata Community Manager, for an individual that has demonstrated entrepreneurial spirit and Strata Community Manager Rising Star, for someone that has made an outstanding contribution early in their career. There’s also an award for Support Team Member and an Essay Award.

The judging panel comprises of Dr Hazel Easthorpe from UNSW, Tracey Rance from NSW Fair Trading, Hera Antoniades from UTS, Christine Byrne from Green Strata and Denise Lee from NABERS. These judges come with a wealth of experience on strata living.

You can lodge your nomination via the Strata Community website. Nominations close at 8am, June 11 2018.

If your scheme isn’t currently a member of Strata Community Australia, you’re welcome to submit a nomination. If you do you’ll receive a complimentary yearly membership worth $100 – this includes a monthly newsletter, invitations to seminars and events, and online resources.
