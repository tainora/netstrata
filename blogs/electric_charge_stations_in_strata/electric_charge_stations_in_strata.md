Many Aussies want to do their bit for the environment. And driving an electric vehicle is definitely one of those options!

In 2035, around 27% of Australia’s new vehicle fleet could be electric, which is over 2.8 million electric vehicles on the road. New developments are starting to market their buildings as “EV Ready” to attract premium values and give their properties an environmentally friendly point of difference.

However, not only is the lack of recharging stations and infrastructure discouraging electric vehicle buyers, strata buildings are generally built with very little spare capacity in the electricity supply cables from the street, or in individual unit switchboards.

So will strata allow you to modify a parking space for a charging station?

While there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, strata schemes could be more open than ever before to approving charging stations in common parking spaces. A charging station would require a motion to be approved and passed by your owners corporation, depending on where and how the equipment would be installed and how it might affect the property’s energy usage.
