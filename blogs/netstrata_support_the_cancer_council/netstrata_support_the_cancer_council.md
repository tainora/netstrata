Netstrata took part in Australia’s largest morning tea this morning raising money for the Cancer Council. There were a few red eyes this morning as some of the team stayed up late baking, fantastic effort by all. Australia’s Largest Morning tea is aiming to raise $11 million for cancer research & patient support. www.biggestmorningtea.com.au.
