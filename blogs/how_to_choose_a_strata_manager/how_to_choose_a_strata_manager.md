When it comes to choosing a strata manager for your scheme, be it a new or existing building, we find that the decision typically comes down to a few key issues.

### Price

Strata owners are like the rest of us; they do not like wasting money. And therefore, understandably, price is front of mind for Owners’ Corporations seeking strata management services in Sydney. But as with anything, you tend to get what you pay for. If your prospective strata manager’s pricing seems too good to be true, then it probably is.

As a reputed Sydney strata manager, Netstrata offers excellent value for money. Our highly skilled and professional strata managers are available when you need them and our pricing structure is completely transparent. At Netstrata, there are no hidden costs for incidentals.

### Knowledge of legislation

Another factor often cited as a major influencer on decision makers is a strata manager’s knowledge of the relevant legislation governing strata schemes. As a strata management company with over 18 years experience in Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle, we know the ins and outs of all the relevant legislation and are proud supporters of Strata Community Australia.

### Capability and experience

But perhaps the biggest factor for many Owners’ Corporations is experience. Given the increase of medium density housing in Sydney, strata managers who have the relevant experience with high volume and  complex schemes are increasingly in demand. The days of simple 10 Unit walk up blocks are gone and with them, we hope, the often ineffectual strata managers of old.

Today, it is increasingly common for buildings and, therefore, schemes to house many more residents. It is also common for buildings to incorporate a mix of residential and commercial spaces. And then there are the pools, gyms and common areas that new buildings typically boast. These developments call for a truly professional strata management offering. And with approximately 800 schemes under management worth some $4.2 billion, Netstrata is the Sydney strata manager best equipped to handle your strata requirements.

At Netstrata, we are so confident that you will be satisfied with our strata management service that we offer No Lock In Contracts.
