Netstrata was  sadly informed of the passing of Mr Larry Quayle; Larry was the Strata Division Manager at Austbrokers Insurance.

Larry suffered a Heart Attack on Tuesday 15/12, after which he was placed in an induced coma. Larry sadly was not able to recover from this & passed away on the morning of Saturday 19/12/2009.

Larry had arranged thousands of quotes for us over the years and with over 40 years experience what Larry didn’t know about strata insurance claims wasn’t worth knowing. Larry was a great person and a true professional and will be missed by all.

Our thoughts are with Larry’s family and the staff of Austbrokers Sydney at this sad time.
