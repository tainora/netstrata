Larry sadly was not able to recover from this & passed away on the morning of Saturday 19/12/2009.\n\nLarry had arranged thousands of quotes for us over the years and with over 40 years experience what Larry didn’t know about strata insurance claims wasn’t worth knowing. Larry was a great person and a true professional and will be missed by all.\n\nOur thoughts are with Larry’s family and the staff of Austbrokers Sydney at this sad time.",
