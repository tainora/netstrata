    "main_content": "With the introduction of public gathering limitations on 29th March, the National Cabinet agreed to further limit most indoor and outdoor non-essential gathering to 2 people as an addition to the rules on essential gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAs advised, we are to stay home unless we are:\n\n- Going to work or education (if unable to do so at home)\n- Shopping for essential supplies such as groceries\n- Going out for personal exercise\n- Attending medical appointments or compassionate visits\n\nA week prior, the following facilities were restricted from opening:\n\n- Pubs, registered and licensed clubs (excluding bottle shops attached to these venues), hotels (excluding accommodation)\n- Gyms and indoor sporting venues\n- Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and night clubs\n- Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery\n\nIf you live in a Scheme with a gym or a pool, there is currently no law in NSW which requires an Owners Corporation to close these facilities. However, there are still restrictions on gatherings of more than 2 people, and further to that, it is a decision for each Owners Corporation to make and the measures it will take to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
