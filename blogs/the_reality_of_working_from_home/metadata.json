Although it’s business as usual at Netstrata, it’s just a little different.\n\nWhilst we acknowledge what our clients and suppliers are going through during the coronavirus pandemic, please take a second to acknowledge that your Strata Manager is going through something similar.\n\nLike you, we are working from home. Whether it be at home alone, sharing a workspace with a partner, working and parenting with small children or the additional challenge of working and schooling. Just under 45% of our staff are working and parenting simultaneously.\n\nLet’s give one another the support we both need in these challenging times, and work together on our common goal of flattening the curve.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
