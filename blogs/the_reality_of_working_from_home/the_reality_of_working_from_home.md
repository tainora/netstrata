As we all sit in the same little egg basket (socially distanced of course…) we must remember that circumstances have changed! Although it’s business as usual at Netstrata, it’s just a little different.

Whilst we acknowledge what our clients and suppliers are going through during the coronavirus pandemic, please take a second to acknowledge that your Strata Manager is going through something similar.

Like you, we are working from home. Whether it be at home alone, sharing a workspace with a partner, working and parenting with small children or the additional challenge of working and schooling. Just under 45% of our staff are working and parenting simultaneously.

Let’s give one another the support we both need in these challenging times, and work together on our common goal of flattening the curve.
