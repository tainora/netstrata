New laws have been introduced by the NSW Department of Fair Trading, to curb the number of injuries to children in window related falls.

Some of the key changes include:

- Owners corporations will be required to install safety devices on all windows that pose a safety risk to children (applies to windows above the ground floor).
- Owners can install safety devices regardless of the by-laws of the strata scheme.
- Owners Corporations are to include window safety devices in the prescribed condition report for rental premises.
- Owners corporations have been given five years to fit window safety devices (from 13 March 2013).
