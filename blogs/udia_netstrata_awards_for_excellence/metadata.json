Netstrata sponsored the Medium Density Award category which recognises medium density development with projects being mainly residential. The 2011 award went to Stockland’s Manta development at Little Bay, congratulations.\n\nOver 600 people attended the awards evening which saw it’s largest number of nominees. From a strata management perspective it is fantastic to see so many quality strata developments being completed.\n\nThe judges made the following comments in relation to Stockland’s Manta:\n\nThe Manta orientation maximises views and cross ventilation and the north facing forecourt together with the related retail and commercial is planned to become the community centre of the Little Bay development. The price point/value for money, and the quality and design of the apartments was confirmed by the 100% sales within a month of the launch. The landscaped roof of the podium adds an attractive amenity for the residents.\n\nCongratulations to all the other finalists including: A2 by FKP Properties, Botanica by Australand, Eko by Crown, Sedyr by Sunland and Parkside at Dunlop by Village Building Company.\n\n[IMAGE_0]",
