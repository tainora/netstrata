Leaving maintenance and repair issues unaddressed also reduces property values and pushes up insurance costs in affected buildings.”\n\nUnder NSW law, owners corporations are legally required to maintain common property. Ignoring or delaying repairs can lead to bigger problems and more expensive remedial works down the track.\n\nThe Health Check contains six questions to answer from the process to reporting repairs, and understanding how much money is available for capital works. There are also questions on insurance cover, hiring licenced tradespeople and reviewing the 10-year capital works plan.\n\nIf, as an owner, you don’t answer “yes” to all questions, then the next step is to reach out to the Strata Committee to seek guidance.\n\nAccording to NSW Fair Trading, neglecting repairs can have a direct impact on insurance.\n\n“This includes:\n\n- increasing the cost of insurance paid by all owners through their levies\n- decreasing the coverage your insurer will provide – they often won’t cover problems caused by a lack of repairs and maintenance\n- increased excess to be paid, as insurance companies will impose higher excess amounts (such as for water damage claims)\n- less choice in insurance provider or inability to obtain cover at all, as insurance companies may decline to insure your building without ongoing repairs and maintenance.”\n\nIn 2024, NSW Fair Trading received more than 500 complaints related to strata issues. Interestingly, 22% of these were about repairs and maintenance – from plumbing and sewerage problems to water leaks.\n\nFor more information on maintaining your property, please contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.",
