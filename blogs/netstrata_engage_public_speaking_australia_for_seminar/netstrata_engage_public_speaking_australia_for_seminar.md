Last Friday the strata manager’s and support team at Netstrata undertook an intensive training session with Greg Stockwell from Public Speaking Australia to learn better presentation skills. Greg has worked with a large number of big corporations, sporting and media identities and politicians; it was a great privilege to have him present for Netstrata.
