Following recent media allegations, Netstrata has agreed with NSW Fair Trading for McGrathNicol Advisory to conduct an independent review of its business operations.

This process is expected to begin on Monday 6 May 2024 and take approximately 5-6 weeks.

Netstrata will carefully consider the results of the independent review and will have more to say at that time. Netstrata wishes to work constructively with NSW Fair Trading to make positive improvements to its operations and by doing so support driving positive change within the industry.

For media enquiries please email feedback@netstrata.com.au with your details and a spokesperson will be in touch.
