Netstrata has a unique approach to the management of strata & community title property. The approach is based on knowing our clients properties. We encourage our managers to get out on the road to visit the properties that they manage (up to 4 site inspections per annum are included within our standard management).

Having a working knowledge of our clients schemes helps us to manage our properties better, saving our owners time and money.
