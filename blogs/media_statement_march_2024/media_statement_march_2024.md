Recent coverage in the media has brought our office’s business operations into focus.

We stand by our practices, but we accept that there is a consumer demand for greater transparency which we will work towards.

Our commitment has always been to drive the necessary change within our organisation and the broader industry to achieve the highest standard of transparent and professional strata management services from which all owners can benefit.

To ensure that our practices remain in accordance with all legislative requirements, we are continuing our own internal audit and looking for better ways to disclose in a meaningful way beyond those requirements.

As already communicated, we have also invited New South Wales Office of Fair Trading to undertake an independent audit of our business operations for an objective regulatory assessment. We are currently awaiting the terms to be shared, and we will openly communicate this once it has commenced.

We are encouraging owners of our schemes to get in contact with their respective Strata Managers or contact our office to alleviate concerns if they have them, and as always, we are more than willing to provide the necessary documentation to outline the financials of each scheme.

Our commitment to providing professional and proactive strata management services for the benefit of our owners remains steadfast.

For media enquiries please email feedback@netstrata.com.au with your details and a spokesperson will be in touch.
