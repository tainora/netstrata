Scammers are using the spread of COVID-19 to take advantage of unsuspecting Australians, and there has been reports of over $700,000 worth of loss since March. Common scams include phishing for personal information, online shopping, and superannuation scams. Netstrata’s highly efficient IT department has blocked 13,217 potential threats – in just 30 days! 93,453 emails were scanned before they were released into our inboxes, and out of the 13k potential threats, there were 129 advanced threats and 15 viruses. We urge you to be cautious of emails you receive, even if they are from trusted sources. Netstrata has received many emails including:

- links to download/preview documentation
- parcel delivery dispatch notices with “click to download”
- server detection emails reporting Inbox errors to “view returned messages”
- fill out this quiz and pass it to a friend “to play, click here”
- documents received from a trusted source with a button to “open attachments”

Please note, you must never input any personal details, passwords or account information. Always telephone the source to ensure the email you received from them is legitimate. If you need to report a scam, please visit the ACCC Scamwatch website.
