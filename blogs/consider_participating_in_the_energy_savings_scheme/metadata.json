This method enables Accredited Certificate Providers (ACP) to retrofit or upgrade lighting, draught proofing and other equipment. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) is responsible for the accreditation.\n\nTo participate, you should first choose an Accredited Certificate Provider that you’d like to work with. Here’s the list of Providers.\n\nThe ACP should provide you with a comprehensive proposal of the recommended changes for your property. As part of the proposal, the ACP may request particular commitments from you. Be sure to ask lots of questions so that you fully understand what’s being proposed and how it will reduce your energy use and therefore your energy costs.\n\nIf you’re renting the property and you’d like to participate in the initiative, you may need to get your landlord’s approval to install or change equipment.\n\nThe cost will depend on the size and scope of work. At a minimum, you’ll have to pay $30 (excluding GST) for the products, installation, assessment and other related expenses. Again, talk with your ACP so that you fully understand the upfront financial commitment. This one-off expense should be off-set by the estimated savings on your energy bills over time. In the long run, you should be better off.\n\nOnce the work has been completed, you should always check that the job has been completed to your satisfaction and in line with what was documented in the proposal. If you’re not satisfied, your first step is to address your concerns with the ACP. If they don’t provide you with a satisfactory remedy, you’re entitled to contact the Energy Savings Scheme. NSW Fair Trading may also be able to assist.\n\nIn addition to the retrofitting of fixtures, you should also consider replacing electrical items with more energy-efficient models – whether that be washing machines, clothes dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators or televisions.\n\nIf you’d like to know more about the scheme, contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
