We recently ran an AGM that had 50% more owners attend than the usual face-to-face meetings!\n\nConnectivity is KEY at the moment, and so is running your Strata Scheme.\n\nStay connected, and if you need help in doing so – ask a friend, a neighbour, a grandchild, or US! We are here for you.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
