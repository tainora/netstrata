While some may see an empty table, we see another way of connecting with you!

We are now running our meetings via video and audio with great success. We recently ran an AGM that had 50% more owners attend than the usual face-to-face meetings!

Connectivity is KEY at the moment, and so is running your Strata Scheme.

Stay connected, and if you need help in doing so – ask a friend, a neighbour, a grandchild, or US! We are here for you.
