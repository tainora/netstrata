It’s traditional at this time of year to reflect on the past 12 months and to come up with changes that you’d like to make in your life so that the coming year will be better than the last. These New Year’s resolutions are generally focused around self-improvement such as going to the gym more, eating more healthy food, drinking less alcohol or reading more books. Here at Netstrata, we think it’s always a good idea to consider including some resolutions that make communal living in a strata scheme even better.

Here are our top five New Year’s resolutions for improved strata living.

### Have a coffee with a neighbour

While pleasantries in the lift are great, it’s a good idea to get to know your neighbours over a coffee. You can chat about life, politics, the weather – it doesn’t matter. We’re not suggesting you need to become best friends but if you know your neighbours better then that will increase the harmony in your scheme. And we all want to enjoy our living space.

### Think about the culture of your scheme

In November 2016 a massive amount of legislative changes on strata living became law. Given that there were so many changes to hit strata schemes, now is the perfect time to start thinking about what type of culture would best suit your scheme. You could even discuss your ideas when you’re having that coffee with a neighbour.

### Get more involved with your scheme

Not everyone wants to be on the Strata Committee (formerly called the Executive Committee). However there’s nothing stopping you from attending the Annual General Meeting or any Extraordinary General Meetings that are called. Rather than throwing minutes from a meeting straight into the paper recycle bin, you could have a read of them. The more informed you are of the operations of your scheme, the better understanding you’ll have of where your levies are being spent and you’ll be better placed when it comes to voting on by-laws.

### Don’t be afraid to voice your concerns

Everyone that lives in a strata environment is entitled to enjoy their apartment without being disturbed by their neighbours – at all times of the day and night. If a neighbour is affecting the enjoyment of your place, don’t be afraid to raise the issue with your strata managing agent. There are processes in place that can ensure all grievances are handled appropriately.

### Undertake that renovation you’ve been putting off

There’s always going to be something you can do to improve your apartment – whether it replaces the blinds, put a new carpet in or give it a new coat of paint. With the new year, now’s the perfect time to get it done. A small change can make a big improvement to the enjoyment of your place. If you decide to do more renovations beyond simple cosmetic changes, always seek approval from your strata managing agent.
