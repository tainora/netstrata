Managing Director Stephen Brell said “having to relocate over 5 years ago from Hurstville to Carlton because our existing premises were being demolished; it is fantastic to now secure our future in the same location. We can now focus wholly on our business strategy of providing the best strata and community title management services, without having to worry about relocating. Over time to we plan to further improve our facilities  to ensure that our clients strata experiences are further enhanced.”
