Coffee in one hand and phone in the other, it’s business as usual in our busy headquarters.\n\nWhile on the other side of the world, Stephen reaches the summit.\n\nFar from meetings, mobile phones and coffee, Stephen and his team trek 500 vertical metres, over 2.5km to witness the first glimpse of sunlight over Everest.\nAnd what a sight!\n\n[IMAGE_0]\n\nFor most of the team, it is an emotional milestone. But they can be proud that every step they took was to raise over $72,000 towards the Leukaemia Foundation for future research and support.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
