It’s Monday morning at Netstrata, and the team are busily arranging their week with appointments, meetings and site visits. Coffee in one hand and phone in the other, it’s business as usual in our busy headquarters.

While on the other side of the world, Stephen reaches the summit.

Far from meetings, mobile phones and coffee, Stephen and his team trek 500 vertical metres, over 2.5km to witness the first glimpse of sunlight over Everest.
And what a sight!

For most of the team, it is an emotional milestone. But they can be proud that every step they took was to raise over $72,000 towards the Leukaemia Foundation for future research and support.
