    "main_content": "For larger strata schemes with multiple lots, appointing a building manager can significantly enhance the efficiency of property management. Depending on the size of a building, and of course their budget; a building manager appointment is typically made at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), decided with a vote by the Owners Corporation. This is a full-time, paid role, meaning it cannot be undertaken voluntarily or on a casual basis. Their presence ensures the scheme runs smoothly by managing day-to-day operations, overseeing property maintenance, and working closely with key stakeholders such as the strata committee, owners corporation, and the strata manager.\n\n## What is a Building Manager?\n\nSometimes referred to as a caretaker, a building manager plays a crucial role in the day-to-day operations of a strata scheme. Their primary responsibility is to oversee building maintenance, compliance, and general property upkeep. While they may not be required to live on-site, being close by allows them to respond quickly to emergencies. Although they cannot enforce by-laws, they can report breaches to strata managers or the owners corporation, ensuring compliance within the community.\n\n## What are the Roles and Responsibilities of a Building Manager?\n\nAccording to NSW Fair Trading, a building site manager plays an essential role in maintaining the functionality and upkeep of common property. They shoulder diverse responsibilities. What do these include?\n\n### The Management of Common Property\n\nA building manager is responsible for ensuring common property areas remain well-maintained. Gardens, hallways, parking lots, and shared recreational spaces all fall under their watchful eye. They coordinate routine maintenance throughout the year. They conduct thorough safety inspections when needed. Any structural concerns that arise must be promptly addressed by this key professional.\n\n### Controlling the Use of Common Property by Tradespersons and Non-Residents\n\nThe role of a building manager includes supervising and approving access to contractors, service providers, and visitors. They monitor all entry and exit protocols. By maintaining strict oversight, they ensure maintenance work proceeds safely without disrupting the community. It’s this careful oversight and control that provides both the physical property and also gives residents peace of mind.\n\n### The Maintenance and Repair of Common Property\n\nBuilding managers play a key role in coordinating preventative maintenance and arranging timely repairs — from plumbing and electrical inspections to day-to-day operational tasks.\n\nWorking closely with the strata manager, they help ensure maintenance is completed on time, within budget, and to a high standard. By regularly liaising with trusted trades, they can identify issues early and prevent them from escalating into costly repairs.\n\nThis proactive, team-based approach helps preserve the value of the property while saving time and money over the long term.\n\n### Duties Such as Concierge, Security, and Cleaning\n\nIn some strata schemes, building managers take on concierge and security responsibilities. They monitor visitor access with vigilance. Managing deliveries and ensuring common areas remain clean and well-presented falls under their purview, and they coordinate cleaning services scheduled throughout the property.\n\n## Building Manager vs. Strata Managers: Differences & Shared Obligations\n\nA building manager and a strata manager each play distinct roles in a strata scheme, but their responsibilities often overlap. Understanding these differences helps owners corporations and residents know who to contact for various concerns.\n\n### Building Managers vs. Strata Managers: Key Differences\n\nA building manager primarily handles the physical maintenance and daily operations of a strata scheme. Their focus is on on-site issues, contractor coordination, and property upkeep.\n\nA strata manager, on the other hand, is responsible for the administrative and financial aspects of strata management. They handle all levies and insurance matters with precision, as well as all compliancecoompliance issues falling squarely within their domain. All governance matters for the scheme must pass through their careful oversight, ensuring proper documentation and procedural correctness at every step.\n\n### How Building Managers and Strata Managers Work Together\n\nWhen a building manager identifies major repairs or maintenance needs, they work with the strata manager to determine how funds will be allocated. The strata manager liaises with the strata committee, ensuring all approvals are met before work begins. Once confirmed, the building manager coordinates on-site repairs and ensures everything runs smoothly.\n\nA strong working relationship between building managers, strata managers, and the Owners Corporation ensures that properties are maintained efficiently and compliance standards are upheld.\n\n## Partner With Netstrata Today\n\nAppointing a building manager is a long-term investment that provides stability, security, and professional oversight for your strata scheme, depending on the size.
