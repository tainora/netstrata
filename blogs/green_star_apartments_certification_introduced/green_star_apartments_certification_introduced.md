Extending their framework for assessing a building’s green credentials, the Green Building Council of Australia has recently launched Green Star apartments. Designed to assist owners and renters make better informed decisions, the GBCA will provide a sustainability rating for individual apartments within a certified building.

“With housing affordability at crisis levels, our cities growing denser, and climate pressures intensifying, the demand for apartments must be met with cost-effective and sustainable solutions,” said Davina Rooney, Green Building Council of Australia CEO.

“The rating system we’re launching today will make it easier for developers to create generation-defining homes. It will help more Australians get their foot in the door in a way which not only saves them money – now and into the future – but also reduces our carbon footprint.”

Apartments that receive a Green Star will help lower carbon emissions, reduce pressure on the energy grid and improve water efficiency. They will also identify homes with better insulation, natural ventilation, and protection against extreme weather.

According to the GBCA, a new Green Star apartment may be slightly more expensive to build upfront (1.3% or $11,700) but the additional cost is outweighed by the long-term gains. Over 30 years it’s calculated that the apartment could generate $111,000 in financial gain on a $900,000 Sydney apartment through cheaper loans, lower energy costs and higher appreciation.

Interestingly according to a survey conducted by Gateway Bank, 87.2% of respondents said an energy-efficient certification would influence their buying decision.

“We know that green finance is one of the key missing links we have when it comes to developing more sustainable apartments, because we know that cost is a key driver of buyers and renters,” said says Davina Rooney.

“But the data also tells us that sustainability is increasingly influencing purchasing decisions. In fact, 81% of buyers now see sustainable property features as either ‘critical’ or ‘important’ in their decision-making.”

“The launch of Green Star apartments will help buyers and renters identify homes that align with these expectations, while also ensuring lower operating costs and improved liveability.”

Since launching in 2020 with three levels of recognition, 4 star, 5 star or 6 star, 400 new buildings are now registered as a Green Star Building.

To obtain certification, builders should register the project through the GBCA online portal and submit the appropriate documentation. An independent panel of sustainability experts assess the submission and then provide a response.

To obtain an apartment certification, the multi-unit residential project must also be registered as a Green Star Building. Applicants can lodge the paperwork for the apartment together with building registration or later.

There aren’t any additional fees to obtain Apartments Pathway. The certification fee for Green Star Buildings includes completion of the Apartments Pathway.
