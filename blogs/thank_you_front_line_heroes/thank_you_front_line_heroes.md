We can’t express how deeply blessed we are to have heroes on the front line, ensuring our families and loved ones are safe while at the same time risking becoming sick themselves and sacrificing time with their loved ones.

We are all doing our own little bit to help flatten the curve so you get to go back to your beautiful families sooner.

Thank you to all the healthcare workers and public service professionals, and anyone who is caring and supporting those who are ill. You are inspiring hope around the world for us all.
