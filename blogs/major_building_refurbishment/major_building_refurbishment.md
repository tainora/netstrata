Netstrata’s Danielle Brell is managing the process in conjunction with building consultant Ian Thompson from Essential Facilities Management. The project at this stage is running 2 months ahead of schedule which is a fantastic result. If your strata scheme is looking for a strata management service that could assist you with a similar project we would be happy to assist.
