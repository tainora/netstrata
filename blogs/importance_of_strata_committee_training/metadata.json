It’s the result of deliberate governance, effective decision-making, and an in-depth understanding of roles and responsibilities. As the saying goes, “Knowledge is power,” and Netstrata is ardent about empowering those who manage and participate in strata communities. That’s why we are thrilled to announce our exclusive Strata Committee Training Seminars designed for our esteemed clients.\n\n#### Decoding the Strata Committee: What and Who?\n\nPreviously known as the ‘executive committee,’ a Strata Committee is essentially the administrative backbone of a strata community. Comprising elected members from the Owners Corporation, the committee serves to facilitate decision-making processes on various aspects that shape the community – from mundane yet crucial tasks like hiring repair services to more complex responsibilities like approving renovation applications under the community’s by-laws.\n\nThe size of a Strata Committee can range from a minimum of one to a maximum of nine members, depending on the specifics outlined by the Owners Corporation. Furthermore, eligibility for committee membership is open, albeit with certain restrictions like barring building managers and individuals who have financial liabilities within the strata scheme at the time of the Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\n#### Beyond Just Decision Making: The Office Bearers\n\nIn addition to general committee members, specific ‘Office Bearer’ roles such as Chairperson, Secretary, and Treasurer are pivotal in strata governance. These roles entail specific tasks like meeting administration, record-keeping, and financial management, thereby shaping the framework that enables efficient strata management.\n\n#### The Crucial Role of a Strata Manager\n\nOften, Strata Committees are supported by Strata Managers—professionals skilled in aiding the Owners Corporation and the committee itself in streamlining the strata scheme’s operations. These tasks can range from conducting meetings and financial oversight to advising on asset management.\n\n#### Why Strata Committee Training is Paramount\n\nGiven the nuanced roles and substantial responsibilities that come with strata management, training isn’t merely beneficial – it’s essential. Netstrata’s Strata Committee Training Seminars aim to spotlight the importance of governance in compliance with strata legislation while also fulfilling stakeholder expectations.\n\nThese tailored training courses offer a nuanced understanding of what’s legally obligatory as opposed to what’s optional or suggestive, providing a robust framework for both new and seasoned committee members.\n\n#### Netstrata’s Dedication to Excellence\n\nAt Netstrata, we recognize that the efficacy of a Strata Committee plays a decisive role in the broader strata community’s well-being. By offering these exclusive quarterly Strata Committee Training Seminars, we aspire to raise the bar for strata community management.\n\nWhether you are a novice assuming your committee responsibilities for the first time, or a veteran in the field, continuous learning is invaluable. Netstrata’s Strata Committee Training aims to equip you with the requisite knowledge and skills, enriching your governance capabilities for a thriving strata community.\n\nJoin us in this transformative journey and elevate your strata management to new heights. After all, effective governance begins with informed decision-making.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
