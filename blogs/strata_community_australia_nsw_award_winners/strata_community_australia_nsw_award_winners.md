We are overjoyed to be named Large Strata Management Business of the Year!

Stephen Brell, Managing Director of Netstrata was visibly overjoyed when our name was announced as winners in the 2019 SCA NSW CHU Strata Community Awards for Excellence Gala. “You can have the best software, best processes or best systems in the world… it means nothing unless you have the best people” Stephen said.

It is with great thanks to not only our incredible team at Netstrata, but also our contractors and our clients that have collectively made this award possible.
