Whether you’re a new owner or just want to understand the process better, we’ve got you covered.

First things first, make sure you’re aware of the AGM date, time, and location. These details are  provided in advance by your strata manager and are displayed on the front cover of the meeting notice and agenda. The agenda outlines the topics to be discussed and the items to be voted on. Review this carefully to understand what is being decided.

There are several ways that owners may cast a vote for a general meeting, they are, firstly, by attending the meeting whether it is in person or on an electronic platform, such as Zoom.

Secondly, if you can’t attend the AGM in person, you have the option to appoint a proxy to vote on your behalf. Fill out the proxy form and ensure it’s submitted before the meeting. The person you elect to be your proxy must then attend the meeting and vote on your behalf. It is important to note that if a strata scheme has more than a 100 lots it is considered to be a large scheme and votes must be cast no later than 24 hours prior to the meeting.

Thirdly, owners may elect to vote by submitting a pre-meeting electronic vote prior to the meeting, this is a great way to cast a vote if you’re unable to attend, however votes must be cast no later than 24 hours prior to the commencement of the meeting.

It is important to note that if a lot within a strata scheme is owned by a company, then a company nominee form, also known as a corporate authorisation form, must be submitted identifying the individuals who are authorised to vote.

Each item on the agenda will be discussed and then the chairperson; usually the strata manager; will call for votes in favour of the motion, or against the motion. Those who are present at the meeting may vote, usually by raising their hand at the appropriate time or using voting cards or applications as instructed by the chairperson. The votes that have been cast via proxy or by a pre-meeting electronic vote will be declared for each motion when determining the result of the motion. For example, if there are 10 people voting at a meeting and are present and 5 pre-meeting votes have been received, the chairperson will normally explain the motion and when calling for a vote, they will detail how the pre-meeting votes were cast for the motion at hand.

Owners who wish not to vote on a particular motion, may abstain from voting on that motion by not casting a vote either in favour or against the motion, or by telling the chairperson that they wish to abstain from voting on the motion.

Once all votes are cast, the chairperson will declare the vote and move on to the next motion. The results of each motion will be detailed in the minutes of the meeting.

It is also important to note that in order to cast a vote at a meeting, owners must be financial. This means that the levy payments must be up to date and any outstanding levies for the lot of which they are representing must be paid and cleared within the building’s trust account prior to the meeting.

Remember, your participation is crucial in shaping your strata community. If you have any further questions, consult your strata manager.
