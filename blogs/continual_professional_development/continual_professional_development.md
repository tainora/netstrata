The strata management team at Netstrata undertook an extensive training program last Friday in their Sydney Offices where they were joined by the Institute of Strata Title Managements Richard Holloway.

As strata management is a dynamic sector continually being effected by legislative changes and different rulings it is paramount to stay up to date with the changes and how it effects our client schemes. During the course we looked at Court Cases making a difference to the sector, debt recovery, building defects and works to owners lots. The floor was also opened to some general question and answers which enabled some positive discussions. All in all a fantastic course and very beneficial.
