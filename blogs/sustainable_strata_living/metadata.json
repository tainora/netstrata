And while there are some dire predictions of what may happen to the earth due to global warming, it’s possible for all of us to do our bit to save the planet.\n\nSo what can we do in a strata situation?\n\nGreen Strata is a Sydney-based company dedicated to promoting sustainable living for strata schemes.\n\n“Green Strata is a response to the problem of how to live more sustainably and with the lowest possible ecological footprint as a collection of households within a building or complex formed and legislated under strata title… We focus solely on helping owners and occupiers of residential multi-unit properties improve the sustainability of their common property and their community of residents,” says the Green Strata website.\n\nHere are some of Green Strata’s recommendations that may assist to minimise harm to the environment and could also save money in the process.\n\nWater Use\nProperties may benefit from water saving devices such as water efficient showerheads that can easily be installed by a qualified plumber.\n\nCommunal Composting\nCreate a communal compost bin for residents. The resulting compost is great for the garden and reduces general rubbish.\n\nFluorescent Lighting\nConsider removing a couple of the fluorescent tubes, if lighting levels in the common areas continue to meet the Australian standards for brightness.\n\nSun Dry Washing\nStrata schemes may consider amending the applicable by-laws, to allow residents to dry washing on the balcony. If appearance is important; maybe restrict the height of the line or permit line drying to a certain day.\n\nMaintain Air Conditioning Units\nSchedule regular maintenance checkups for air conditioning units to ensure there are no leaks.\n\nPumps, Motors and Fans\nCarry out an audit of all pumps, motors and fans used on the common property and assess whether it’s possible to reduce their operating times without sacrificing the enjoyment of the residents.\n\nNo Junk Mail\nPut “no junk mail” stickers on the mail boxes. This will reduce the volume of unwanted paper placed into the recycling bins.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding how to maximise your scheme’s green credentials, contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
