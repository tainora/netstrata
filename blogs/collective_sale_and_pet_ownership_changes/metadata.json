However those in the minority can take their position to court triggering legal fees that until now could be incurred by the ownership corporation.\n\nThis legislation will help to alleviate lengthy delays and additional substantial costs in selling properties due to the court process.\n\n“We are now seeing safeguards that were intended to support owners in renewing their strata schemes being used against them,” said Jihad Dib, Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government.\n\n“This reform will help restore balance, improve transparency and boost protections for owners in the collective sale and redevelopment process.”\n\nAlso on the Government’s agenda is pet ownership. They want to make it easier and fairer for residents to keep pets by prohibiting fees, bonds or insurance as a condition of having a pet.\n\nCurrently owners corporation can’t prevent residents from keeping a pet unless the pet causes “unreasonable interference”, and the pet can’t disturb other residents in the scheme. Pet owners usually need to notify the owners corporation in writing of their intentions to keep a pet in advance. Tenants also need permission from the landlord to keep the pet.\n\nIn some instances, pet owners are also being charged a fee, bond or insurance to keep the pet – a practice that will be illegal once the legislation is passed.\n\nThere may be specific by-laws for individual schemes in relation to pet ownership that may cover monitoring your pet when on common property or keeping your animal within your property.\n\nIf you have any questions about collective sales or pet ownership, please contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
