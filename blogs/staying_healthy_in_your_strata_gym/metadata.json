    "main_content": "Being fit and healthy is a goal that many of us aspire to achieve. But we’re time poor so finding that spare 30 minutes to hit the gym can be more challenging than 12 reps on the bench press. That’s why many new strata buildings consider a gym a mandatory addition.\n\nThere’s a convenience about having a gym several floors below or above your apartment. You can always pop in for a quick intensive session before heading off to work. Inclement weather is no longer an excuse not to hit the cross trainer. And you can shower in your own apartment rather than dealing with the communal showers in a commercial gym. In general you probably won’t have to fight to use the equipment or ask to do a “set in between” another gym goer.\n\nTogether with a pool, gyms can be a great asset to the scheme. They can add to the sense of community – through a shared desire to stay healthy, owners can get to know each other. The tighter the bond between owners, the easier it is to resolve issues should they arise. You might also find a training partner in the building that will motivate you to stay focused on your goals even when you’d prefer to chill out in front of the television.\n\nWhile gyms add value to the building and therefore to the individual apartments, there is an expense to maintaining the equipment. This expense is covered by the owners through the strata levies. You’re essentially paying for a membership to an exclusive gym that’s only open to a select clientele. And because you’re part of the scheme, you have a direct say on the types of equipment required for the gym.\n\nIf you’re considering adding a gym to existing common property, Owners Corporations need to be aware of the additional noise that gyms can create. Weights being dropped on the floor and pin-loaded machines can contribute to noise. At Netstrata we recommend that you consult with noise minimisation acoustic experts who can advise on the best flooring and underlay that will prevent ambient noise travelling from the gym into the neighbouring apartments – both below, above and adjacent.\n\nYou may also consider passing a by-law that limits access to the gym during certain hours. It’s not uncommon for the gym (and pool) to be closed between the hours of 11pm and 6am. This way the sleep of the other residents isn’t disturbed. In general, common sense should prevail. Even if you’re using the gym at lunchtime, there’s no need to pump up the volume of the music to levels more suited to a nightclub.\n\nIf you have any more questions about the gym in your scheme, contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
