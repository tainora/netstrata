    "main_content": "Following our determination to offer superior strata services to prestige properties throughout Sydney, the Netstrata team are delighted to announce that we have recently added two new schemes to our existing portfolio.\n\nNoted as Sydney’s highest residential tower, the Metro Residences in Chatswood rises 240 metres above sea level and offers 552 apartments on 46 floors have that been dubbed “skyhomes.” The upper levels boast three and four bedroom options and there are five exceptional penthouses that offer views across to the CBD, out to Manly in the east and over the Ku-ring-gai National Park in the north.\n\nTo take full advantage of the expansive vistas, the architects at Cox Richardson Architects designed the apartments with floor to ceiling windows and an open plan living area that flows instinctively to the balcony. The residents can also enjoy the communal 25 metre pool, gym and landscaped gardens.\n\nThis impressive property is located only moments from the centre of Chatswood’s commercial district – Westfield and Chatswood Chase are virtually on the doorstep. While the structure also has parking spaces, Chatswood train station is located conveniently below the building with trains linking commuters to Sydney’s CBD and Macquarie Park in around 15 minutes in each direction.\n\nIn the heart of Sydney’s CBD, the Owners Corporation of the 17-storey building, Eliza in Elizabeth Street have also recently engaged Netstrata as their strata managing agent. This iconic building, which faces Hyde Park and has views across to St Mary’s Cathedral, attracted significant media interest last year because of the opulent three-level, 499 square metre penthouse that features a 10-metre marble staircase, internal lift and infinity pool. Taking full advantage of the views, there are four bedrooms, six bathrooms and a private lobby.\n\nThere are also eight whole floor apartments that each have four bedrooms with marble ensuites, limestone floors with underfloor heating and Porcelanosa kitchens with Gaggenau appliances.\n\nFrom an architectural perspective, the facade of the building is particularly striking. The architect, Tony Owen, has created a somewhat 3D effect, with each floor featuring a unique wave.\n\nTony Owen told The Australian that, “because it was a relatively small site, it was a challenge to cleverly plan to max­imise space, sunlight and views. Because it’s a significant heritage street, our design is cutting-edge but we made sure to use trad­itional materials like sandstone so it would fit the area.”\n\nFor a confidential discussion about your strata scheme, please contact the Strata Managers at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
