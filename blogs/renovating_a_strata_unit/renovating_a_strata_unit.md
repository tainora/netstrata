With the introduction of the new Home Builder Scheme, there are now many of us who can’t wait to do a spot of renovating!

There are 3 types of renovations for strata homes: cosmetic work, minor renovations or major renovations.

Owners can do cosmetic work without approval; however minor renovations need approval by the Owners Corporation and major renovations needs a special resolution vote.

Be sure to speak to your Strata Manager to discuss your renovation plans in detail. In the meantime, check out the NSW Fair Trading website to see further info on the types of renovations for strata homes: https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/strata-and-community-living/strata-schemes/renovations
