Netstrata is proud to be involved with the Ronald McDonald House Charities with our strata managers and support team making a monthly donation to this fantastic cause. Netstrata received a thank you letter today from Malcolm Coutts CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities Australia along with the Annual Report for the last financial year. Netstrata’s contribution assisted in providing accommodation for over 6000 families last year whilst their seriously ill children were receiving treatment in hospital.

Netstrata is proud to be part of the RMHC Family, for anybody wishing to find out more about the charity please visit their website at www.rmhc.org.au.
