Having served as a board member since 2017, Stephen Brell was recently appointed President of the Strata Community Association (NSW).

SCA (NSW) is the peak industry body for Strata and Community Title Management in New South Wales. Membership includes strata managers, support staff, committee members and suppliers of products and services to the industry.

SCA (NSW) has more than 3,000 members who help oversee, advise or manage over 750,000 lots in NSW, and fulfils the dual roles of a professional institute and consumer advocate. SCA (NSW) champions consumer rights and advocates for the highest industry standards, empowering its members to be the very best they can be.

Stephen has more than 20 years of strata management experience and is the Managing Director and Licensee–in-Charge of the Netstrata group of companies. He’s a licensed strata managing agent and real estate agent, and a registered property valuer. Stephen has served on a number of industry working groups and SCA (NSW) committees.

He has lectured at TAFE NSW and for the Institute of Strata Title Management (now Strata Community Australia) on Strata and Community Title Management.

In taking on the position as President, Stephen acknowledges the fantastic contribution and achievements that his predecessor, Chris Duggan made. Chris remains as an SCA (NSW) Board Director and steps into the role as SCA (National) President.

Stephen also congratulates Emily Doherty, Peter Brisbane and David Bannerman for their re-appointment to the board, and to the newly appointed board member Geoffrey Linders.
