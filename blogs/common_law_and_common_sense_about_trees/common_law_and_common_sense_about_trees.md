Overhanging or invasive trees are a common cause of dispute in strata communities and otherwise. There are steps and measure you can take to avoid these disputes escalating out of control.

Read this week’s training note and Many thanks to TEYS lawyers for this article here are some tips on how not to go too far!
Each state and territory by now has its own legislation about tree disputes and if a dispute goes far enough, then these laws should be referenced. This note looks at the common law and some common sense on the topic.

There are trees to avoid planting and places to avoid planting them. A rubber plant

will find pipes and drains on the other side of the city if that’s how far it has to go

for a drink. A by-law about what can be planted and where, is a good use of the

by-law making powers of an owners corporation.
You don’t need council approval to plant a tree but you might need approval to

bring one down. Check for tree preservation orders in your local council before

having a working bee with chainsaws at the ready. (Also check your insurance

before letting the secretary rip with anything sharper than a pen).
Local councils are responsible for trees on pavements, grass verges and nature

strips, so don’t waste owners corporation money on these matters, exercise your

right to complain to the authorities to get this work done.
Branches and roots from a neighbour’s tree can be pruned and the material

returned to the tree owner’s property, but again be careful of preservation orders

before taking to the intruder. Also, it might be an idea to talk to the neighbour first

before cutting down half the magnolia and hurling the cuttings into their pool.
The common law of nuisance applies to physical land or buildings but does not

include the right to sunlight or an unobstructed view. In some places, including

Sydney, there is legislation about hedges blocking views so look for this if the Opera House is fading to green.

Thank you TEYS Lawyers.
