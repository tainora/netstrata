Netstrata was proud to support Vision Australia’s Illawarra Black & White Race Day held at Kembla Grange on Saturday 8th October 2011. It was a fantastic day although a little wet, Netstrata Wollongong’s Tanya Gough said “It was great to see so much of the Wollongong Business and Local Community digging deep for a fantastic cause”.

Vision Australia is a partnership between people who are blind, sighted or have low vision. We are united by their passion that people who are blind or have low vision will have access to and fully participate in every part of life they choose.
