    "main_content": "Joining your strata scheme’s Strata Committee can be a rewarding experience. You’ll have the opportunity to influence the direction of the scheme and make a real impact to the property.\n\nThe Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 sets out the requirements for the Strata Committee. The Department of Fair Trading website states that the Committee, “is responsible for the day-to-day running of the strata scheme and is elected at each annual general meeting (AGM). The owners corporation decides the number of strata committee members for the coming year at each AGM. It can have from 1–9 members, but in a two-lot scheme both owners must be members. A large scheme (more than 100 lots) must have at least 3 members on its committee.”\n\nThere is no legal requirement for how many meetings a Strata Committee must hold. It’s up to the committee members to decide the frequency of meetings for their specific needs. Maybe ask a current member how often they meet to ensure that you can attend.\n\nPutting your name forward at the AGM can be a daunting prospect if you’ve never served on an Strata Committee previously. To put you at ease and to equip you with the essential background information, Strata Community Australia have set up a free online training course.\n\nFrom the comfort of your home, you’ll be able to learn about the roles and responsibilities of each committee member. There’s also a section on how to work with your Strata Manager, other owners and also the contractors employed to carry out maintenance on the building.\n\nOverall there are five key topics including governance and ethics, roles and responsibilities, strata plan interpretation, administrative matters and communication. The glossary of terms at the end of each section is particularly useful. Buzz words tend to be thrown around – so now you’ll be able to keep with the lingo.\n\nThe interface is easy to use. Once you’ve signed up to the course, you can login using your secure password. You’ll then be presented with six virtual ring binder folders. At your own pace, you can read through the pages in each folder and complete the optional activities. There’s even a place to leave notes. And because it’s online, you can return at any time to these modules for a refresher or to clarify a particular point.\n\nIt’s important to note that while this course is designed specifically for future and current Strata Committee members, any person can sign up and complete the course. The information covered in the modules is relevant to anyone living in a strata-titled property.\n\nIf you have any questions about being a Strata Committee member, contact your Strata Manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
