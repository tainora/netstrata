Macquarie Bank has invested heavily in their systems, which are compatible with ours, for easy downloads of payments and BPAY payments to creditors. This creates internal efficiencies and reduces errors. They also offer a number of payment facilities for our clients. As market leaders, Macquarie Bank, understands the industry and have competitive rates for investment and term deposit accounts.\n\nAt Netstrata, our strata managers regularly monitor the trust accounts to ensure our clients’ funds continue to perform to their full potential.\n\nWhen opening a new trust account, by law, we’re required to notify Macquarie Bank in writing that we require a trust account and it’s to be in the name of the corporation. When closing the account, we’re required to notify the Director-General of the closure.\n\nThere are also legal obligations for the financial institution. They must tell the Director-General the number of trust accounts opened and closed during the previous month. They must also submit monthly reports on their active trust accounts to the Director-General.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the funds contained in your trust account, don’t hesitate to contact your strata manager at Netstrata.\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up to our monthly newsletter, you’ll be the first to get the latest news and updates from our team.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](https://netstrata.com.au/subscribe/)",
