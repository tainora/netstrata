The strata sector in New South Wales enters a new chapter with the recent appointment of Angus Abadee as the state’s Strata and Property Services Commissioner.

Announced by Minister for Better Regulation and Fair Trading Anoulack Chanthivong, Mr Abadee will lead the strategic direction of the Office of the Property Services Commissioner. His mandate includes lifting standards across strata and property services, enhancing consumer protections and driving industry reform that benefits owners, tenants and professionals alike.

With a strong background in legal and regulatory environments, Mr Abadee brings a considered and proactive approach to the challenges and opportunities within the sector. His appointment has been welcomed across the industry as a positive step toward greater transparency, accountability and responsiveness, key values that strata communities have long called for.

At Netstrata, we see this as a timely and encouraging development. The strata landscape has grown in complexity and scale, and it is vital to have clear leadership from within government to support both consumers and the professionals who serve them.

We look forward to seeing the Commissioner’s impact on improving regulatory outcomes, supporting education and professional standards, and championing policies that reflect the needs of owners corporations across the state.

We welcome Mr Abadee to the role and remain committed to working collaboratively with his office to strengthen outcomes for all stakeholders in the strata and property services sector.
