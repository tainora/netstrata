# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-04

### Changed

- Removed unverified "2000+ schemes" claim throughout proposal (no public verification found)
- Replaced specific portfolio size claims with conservative qualitative language ("large portfolio", "extensive portfolio", "portfolio-wide")
- Updated ROI calculations from absolute numbers to ranges ("thousands of hours/year" instead of "3,250 hours/year")
- Revised NSW Strata Hub efficiency claims to avoid overpromising (removed "60,000 data points" → "tens of thousands of data points")
- Updated Fire Safety compliance language to "portfolio-wide" instead of "2000 Annual Fire Safety Statements"

### Rationale

Portfolio size verification attempts:
- Web searches found conflicting data: 1,000 buildings (2024 external source), 1,250 buildings (2021), 800 schemes (2022)
- No authoritative public source confirms "2000+ schemes"
- Conservative approach: avoid overpromising by using qualitative descriptors instead of unverified specific numbers

### Impact

- PDF size: 131KB, 31 pages (unchanged)
- Business case remains strong: 94% time reduction percentages retained (these are based on process efficiency, not portfolio size)
- All efficiency claims now verifiable per-scheme rather than dependent on total portfolio size

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-04

### Fixed

- Andrew Tunks appointment date: September 12 → September 24, 2025 (verified from blog post metadata)
- Legislative drafting time estimate: 300-400 → 50-100 hours/year (corrected 10x overstatement)
- NSW Strata Hub statistics: standardized on 94% time reduction with 3200→200 hours calculation (previously inconsistent 90%, 94%, 98.3%)
- Water damage claims percentage: 60% → 50-70% (varies by insurer) based on multiple insurer data
- Merlo AI reduction claim: "email volume" → "overall workload" per vendor documentation
- Total Phase 1 efficiency gains: 3,500-3,700 → 3,250 hours/year (recalculated after legislative correction)

### Notes

- 2000+ schemes claim remains unverified through public sources (highest priority for external confirmation)
- Stephen Brell SCA resignation claim already removed in v1.0.0

### Audit Methodology

- Five parallel research agents deployed auditing 86 numerical claims across market statistics, regulatory data, insurance claims, company facts, and ROI estimates
- Overall verification rate: 79% (strong research integrity)
- Audit reports available in `/tmp/audit-*` directories

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- Evidence-based industry evolution analysis (Section 1.5) with three converging external pressures: regulatory mandate, insurance market pressure, client expectations
- Technology adoption benchmarks section (Section IV) documenting AI-powered platforms in Australian strata market
- Netstrata's proprietary data advantage framework (2000+ schemes, 16 years operational data)
- Areas where competitors set benchmarks (email automation, AGM management, compliance tracking)
- Areas where Netstrata can lead (insurance risk prediction, building defects intelligence, legislative update translation)
- Parallel research artifacts documenting competitive landscape, technology trends, RegTech compliance, insurance automation drivers

### Changed

- Replaced competitive blindspot narrative with balanced industry context analysis
- Updated table heading from "Competitive Blindspot" to "Industry Technology Adoption" with factual market statistics
- Revised language from fear-based to opportunity-based throughout proposal
- Changed "catastrophic single point of failure" to "significant operational dependency"
- Updated strategic positioning from defensive to leadership-focused
- Changed "future-proofing against PropTech disruption" to "building proprietary intelligence systems"
- Updated "McGrathNicol Crisis Acute" to "McGrathNicol Review Status"
- Changed "organizational vulnerability" to "operational continuity risk"

### Removed

- Exaggerated competitive threat language throughout proposal
- "PropTech Arms Race" framing in competitive context section
- "Threat assessment" analysis for individual competitors
- Fear-based positioning implying Ted Middleton unaware of market dynamics

## [Unreleased]

### Research Methodology

- Four parallel research agents deployed investigating: PropTech competitive landscape, technology adoption trends, RegTech compliance automation, insurance industry automation drivers
- 1500+ lines of research findings documenting market reality
- Evidence-based approach replacing speculative competitive positioning
