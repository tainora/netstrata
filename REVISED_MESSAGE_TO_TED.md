# Revised Message to Ted Middleton

## Email

**Subject:** Following up on our conversation - Employment opportunity clarification

---

Hi Ted,

Thanks for taking the time to talk last week. I've been reflecting on our conversation and realized I initially misunderstood the opportunity.

**What I now understand:**

You're exploring whether I could contribute as a **team member** helping complete your proprietary software (end 2026 timeline), working with Tom Bakani's software operations team and supporting Andrew Tunks' operational efficiency mandate.

This is **employment**, not productization consulting. The software is your competitive advantage to protect, not commercialize externally.

**The three obstacles you identified:**

1. **Work visa sponsorship** - I've researched the Subclass 482 pathway. For Software Engineer roles at AUD $100K-$130K, the process appears straightforward (employer costs ~AUD $6K, 2-4 month timeline). I'm attaching a summary.

2. **Age/timeline** - I'm 49, with 15 years left. I'm treating this as my final career move. Relocating to Sydney would only make sense if this is a long-term fit for both of us.

3. **Family relocation** - I'm mentally prepared for extended family separation while the kids finish university (2-3 years). It's not ideal, but I've already accepted this for other opportunities I'm exploring.

**On Mum's wishes:**

She's mentioned she'd like me in Sydney long-term. I understand why. But I don't want that to be part of your calculation. If there's a fit based on capability and business needs, great. If not, I'd rather know honestly.

**Next steps (following your guidance):**

I'm attaching three brief documents for your review:

1. Technical background (2 pages)
2. Work visa pathway summary (1 page)
3. What I learned researching Netstrata (3 pages - shows I've done my homework)

When you're available after the November 27 AGM, I'd appreciate an introduction to Cheryl Williams to discuss whether there's a mutual fit.

No rush - I know you're buried in board work through the end of the month.

Best,
Terry

## Analysis of Revision

### What Changed (And Why)

**BEFORE (1,070 words):**

- Productization pitch conflicting with Ted's strategy
- Consultant/auditor framing
- Residual income requests
- 23 paragraphs of complex nested logic
- Emphasis on AI capabilities Ted is skeptical of

**AFTER (280 words):**

- Employment focus aligned with Ted's offer
- Team member framing (working WITH Tom Bakani)
- Zero financial asks (capability first)
- 8 short paragraphs with clear structure
- Focuses on addressing Ted's stated obstacles

### Key Strategic Shifts

#### 1. **Opens with Accountability**

```
"I've been reflecting on our conversation and realized I initially
misunderstood the opportunity."
```

**Why:** Shows you listened to Ted's correction about industry sophistication. Demonstrates self-awareness rather than doubling down on wrong premise.

#### 2. **Names the Right People**

```
"working with Tom Bakani's software operations team and supporting
Andrew Tunks' operational efficiency mandate"
```

**Why:** Positions as team member joining existing leadership, not external consultant evaluating their work. Avoids triggering defensive reaction Ted warned about.

#### 3. **Addresses All Three Obstacles Directly**

Ted explicitly raised:

- Work visa (called it "critical obstacle")
- Age/timeline ("the difficulty you've got, let's be honest, is your age")
- Family/relocation ("what about your family?")

**Original message:** Vaguely mentioned "remote work capability" - avoided obstacles

**Revision:** Tackles each head-on with concrete research (visa pathway), honest framing (15 years = final career move), and reality acceptance (family separation)

**Why:** Ted values directness. Avoiding hard topics signals you're uncomfortable with difficult conversations.

#### 4. **Family Boundary - Simplified**

**Original (too elaborate):**

> "On a personal note, Mum has also said she would like me to spend more time in Sydney in the future, as she may eventually spend more of her own time there and it would make things easier if I were based nearby. I understand why she feels that way. At the same time, I do not want that family wish to become part of the 'calculation' on your side. I think it would be unhealthy for both of us if a business or product decision was driven by making family logistics easier, rather than by whether there is a real opportunity that makes sense for Netstrata and for me."

**Revision (clean and brief):**

> "On Mum's wishes: She's mentioned she'd like me in Sydney long-term. I understand why. But I don't want that to be part of your calculation."

**Why:** Original version drew too much attention to family dynamics and over-explained. Revision states the boundary cleanly without making it a big deal.

#### 5. **Follows Ted's Process Exactly**

**Ted's instruction:** "Send me what you've got" → "First person I'd get you to talk to is Cheryl Williams"

**Revision:**

- Sends brief materials (6 pages total)
- Explicitly requests Cheryl Williams introduction
- Respects Ted's timeline (post-Nov 27)
- No pressure for immediate decision

**Why:** Ted gave clear guidance. Following it exactly shows you listen and respect his process.

#### 6. **Removes ALL Premature Financial Discussion**

**Original:** Residual income, equity participation, long-term upside requests

**Revision:** Zero mention of compensation structure

**Why:** Ted's culture = "capability of people, nothing else." Prove value first, discuss compensation later.

---

## What Makes This Revision Work

### 1. **Respects Power Dynamics**

**Original:** Positioned Terry as advisor evaluating whether to help Netstrata

**Revision:** Positions Terry as candidate hoping to join team if there's a fit

**Why:** Ted is Chairman of the Board with 40+ years experience building successful company. Terry is 49-year-old job seeker. Power dynamic was inverted in original.

### 2. **Proves Listening**

References specific things Ted said:

- Tom Bakani's team (software operations)
- Andrew Tunks' mandate (operational efficiency)
- End 2026 timeline
- Cheryl Williams introduction
- "Not ready yet" for WA customer
- Competitive advantage protection (not commercialization)

**Why:** Shows you absorbed the conversation, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

### 3. **Avoids All Credibility Traps**

**Original traps:**

- SaaS sophistication mismatch (Ted said "you're reading too much sophistication into the industry")
- AI hype (Ted is skeptical)
- Productization pitch (Ted wants internal completion)
- Team audit framing (creates friction Ted warned about)

**Revision:** Avoids all of these by focusing on joining existing efforts.

### 4. **Addresses Uncomfortable Truths**

**Age:** "I'm 49, with 15 years left. I'm treating this as my final career move."

**Family separation:** "I'm mentally prepared for extended family separation... It's not ideal, but I've already accepted this"

**Mum's wishes:** Brief acknowledgment without making it Ted's problem

**Why:** Ted values honesty. He was direct about obstacles - matching that tone builds trust.

### 5. **Creates Easy "Yes" Path for Ted**

**All Ted needs to do:**

1. Skim 6 pages when he has time (post-AGM)
2. Forward to Cheryl Williams with note: "Please evaluate"
3. Done

**No complex decisions required:**

- Not evaluating advisory proposal
- Not assessing ROI projections
- Not making hiring decision
- Just: "Is this worth Cheryl's time to assess?"

### 6. **Zero Manipulation**

**Family:** Acknowledged mum's wishes but explicitly asked Ted NOT to factor it in

**Relationship:** No leveraging of "everything you've done for my family"

**Timing:** No pressure despite Ted being busy

**Financial:** No equity/income asks

**Why:** Ted specifically said "capability of people, nothing else" - this message delivers on that.

## Risk Assessment of Revision

### Remaining Risks (LOW):

1. **Ted may not remember conversation details** - Risk mitigated by referencing specific names (Tom, Andrew, Cheryl)

2. **Cheryl Williams may see family connection as red flag** - Risk addressed by transparency and capability-first framing

3. **Work visa costs may be barrier** - Risk mitigated by providing concrete numbers (AUD $6K-$8K) showing it's not prohibitive

4. **Age concern remains** - Risk acknowledged directly rather than avoided

### Why This Version Is Safe to Send:

✅ **Factually aligned** with Ted's actual offer (employment, not productization)
✅ **Follows Ted's process** (materials → Cheryl Williams)
✅ **Respects timeline** (post-Nov 27 AGM)
✅ **Addresses obstacles** (visa, age, family)
✅ **Brief enough** to read in 2 minutes
✅ **Forward-able** to HR without Ted having to explain context
✅ **No premature asks** (compensation, equity, decisions)
✅ **Professional tone** matching Ted's directness

## Final Recommendation

**SEND THIS VERSION** with three brief attachments (6 pages total).

**Timing:** This week (before Nov 11 as Ted suggested)

**What happens next:**

1. Ted reviews when available (post-Nov 27)
2. If interested, forwards to Cheryl Williams (HR)
3. Cheryl evaluates employment fit
4. If Cheryl recommends, formal discussions begin
5. Work visa sponsorship assessed as part of offer

**If Ted doesn't respond:**

- Don't follow up before Nov 27 (he said he's buried)
- Single follow-up post-AGM: "Checking if you had a chance to review materials - no rush"
- If still no response, take as answer and focus on other opportunities

**Success criteria:**
Ted forwards to Cheryl Williams = WIN (you got the HR introduction you actually needed)

---

## Why This Works

The original message asked Ted to solve Terry's problems:

- "I need financial security in my 50s"
- "I want residual income"
- "Let me evaluate your team's work"

The revision offers to help Ted solve Netstrata's problems:

- "I researched the visa pathway (your obstacle #1)"
- "I understand the 2026 software completion timeline"
- "I want to join Tom's team as a contributor"

**Bottom line:** The original was about what Terry wants. The revision is about what Ted needs and whether Terry can help deliver it.

That's the difference between a message that gets deleted and one that gets forwarded to HR.
