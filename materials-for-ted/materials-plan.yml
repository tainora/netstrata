    critical_issues:
      - "C1: Tom Bakani precedent misrepresentation - Ted said 'no sponsored employees now' but documents frame as positive precedent"
      - "C2: McGrathNicol deadline July 1, 2025 is 4 months past with no outcome mentioned"
      - "C3: Current employment status unclear - 'I work as' with no context on employer/why leaving"
    high_risk_issues:
      - "H1: Migration tools from 'previous roles' vague and unverifiable"
      - "H2: 15-year career horizon may signal short-term investment"

          - "Tom Bakani (Netstrata previously sponsored from Philippines)" precedent removed (materials-plan.yml line 91)

        kept:
          - "under 45 years old" requirement (line 19) - kept as official visa requirement explanation
          - "PR age exemption" generic references (lines 77, 89) - kept as generic policy descriptions
        rationale: "Remove specific age mentions while retaining necessary visa requirement explanations"

      materials_plan_yml_updates:
        - Leadership description: Added full titles "Software Operations" and "IT Infrastructure" for clarity
        - Removed sponsorship precedent reference entirely
        - Updated PR pathway description to "salary-based age exemption available" (generic)

    changes: "Add professional navy blue styling to hyperlinks for visual noticeability"
    status: "completed"
    scope: "Configure LaTeX hyperref package to display all hyperlinks in professional navy blue color"
    git_commit: "TBD"

    styling_configuration:
      method: "\\AtBeginDocument LaTeX Hook (After Failed Attempts)"
      file: "/Users/terryli/.claude/skills/pandoc-pdf-generation/assets/table-spacing-template.tex"
      lines_added: "92-107 (16 lines)"
      configuration:
        color_definition: "\\definecolor{navyblue}{RGB}{0,51,102}"
        hook: "\\AtBeginDocument{\\hypersetup{colorlinks=true, allcolors=navyblue, pdfborderstyle={}}}"
        why_hook_needed: "Pandoc loads hyperref AFTER preamble - direct config gets overridden"
        why_rgb_color: "xcolor loaded without dvipsnames option - NavyBlue undefined, RGB explicit"

    implementation_challenges:
      failed_attempt_1:
        approach: "Added hyperref config directly in LaTeX preamble"
        result: "No effect - hyperlinks remained invisible"
        root_cause: "Pandoc loads hyperref AFTER preamble inclusion, overriding settings"

      failed_attempt_2:
        approach: "Added -V colorlinks flags to build-pdf.sh command line"
        result: "CRITICAL - Completely broke layout (landscape→portrait, fonts changed)"
        root_cause: "NavyBlue color undefined (xcolor loaded without dvipsnames), LaTeX errors cascaded"
        recovery: "Reverted both build-pdf.sh and preamble to original state"

      successful_solution:
        approach: "\\AtBeginDocument hook with RGB-defined color"
        why_it_works: "Hook executes AFTER Pandoc loads hyperref, RGB definition avoids dvipsnames dependency"
        result: "Navy blue hyperlinks visible, layout preserved (landscape, fonts, spacing intact)"

    rationale:
      problem: "Hyperlinks were invisible in PDFs unless hovering - poor user experience"
      solution: "Professional navy blue color via \\AtBeginDocument hook to override Pandoc defaults"
      color_choice: "RGB(0,51,102) navy blue is sophisticated, print-friendly, and doesn't require dvipsnames"
      technical_requirement: "Must not break existing landscape layout or fonts"

    benefits:
      - "Hyperlinks immediately visible to readers"
      - "Professional appearance suitable for employment materials"
      - "Works in all PDF viewers (Preview, Adobe Reader, Chrome)"
      - "Print-friendly - dark enough to read in black & white printing"
