# Context Notes from Ted Middleton

Eric,

As promised.

There may be a few cryptic references in there (acronyms, names, etc.) which I've briefly summarised below rather than have you searching the net - which may not yield accurate results anyway.

## Glossary

**Strata Space (SS)**
Our proprietary strata management software system in development since ~2016, first entered use ~2019 and now still assuming/absorbing the functions of SMP.

**SMP (Strata Manager Pro)**
Our first proprietary strata management software originally developed from ~2007, the complete ownership of which we assumed in 2011. Due for retirement early 2027.

**L&D**
Our company's Learning & Development department - which does precisely what the name suggests across all our business operations.

**Richardson**
A strata management company in Perth, WA that are the only external user of SMP software right now. They are gradually being migrated across to some SS functions, but gradual is the operative word there, as they are probably 5 years behind SS's coalface as used at Netstrata.

**Netstrata Space**
The client-facing mobile app hanging off SS.

**MYOB (MYOB Accounting Enterprise)**
The client accounting engine in SS. This is very powerful professional accounting software where, for SS users, the interface has been simplified (dumbed-down?) for use (even understanding) by non-accountants.

**DMS**
Document management system. Virtually all our internal operations are paperless (since ~2011) with the DMS incorporated into SMP (originally) which is now (next month) migrating to SS.

**Time Recording**
Recording of every client-facing activity has been a function of SMP since 2011 which will now - with a quantum increase in accuracy and sophistication - migrate to SS next month.

**Epi**
Epi Neto, our IT administrator. Epi recently completed a post-grad masters in AI and is, apart from his routine administrator duties, leading our (baby steps, for now) into the AI environment.

You should be able to get all the rest.

Cheers,
Ted
