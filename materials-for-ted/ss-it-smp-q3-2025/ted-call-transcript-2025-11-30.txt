Ted Middleton
I've got your sound yet.

Terry Li
Yeah, is it better? Like, you got me? Yeah, I've got you now. Okay, thanks.

Ted Middleton
Okay.

Terry Li
Yup, thanks for meeting me.

Ted Middleton
Oh, that's alright. Look, I do apologize for it taking so long. I know you sent that to me quite a while ago, but it just happened to be at the wrong time.

Terry Li
I knew that. Yeah.

Ted Middleton
No, no, no.

Terry Li
It's fine.

Ted Middleton
I feel like explaining it to you. I just, you know, when I'm, the trouble is the older I get, the more concentration this takes on me, you know, so whenever I get it, particularly this meeting, because it's financial year end, the 30th of June in Australia. So this, This meeting is the annual general meeting of the company, five board meetings, and it's a particularly big one. um, So it just took more than the usual amount of effort. Anyway, that was over with a couple of days ago, and now I'm starting to deal with my other domestic commitments. I've got, I've just reminded myself, unfortunately, every time I stop to do something here, I get interrupted. And I, it just doesn't matter. I jammed my finger in the lining board this morning. And I didn't realize how much you actually use your finger when you're scrolling.

Terry Li
When there's a payday on it, it doesn't work so well.

Ted Middleton
So I can have a way to scroll with my index finger. Yeah, you read the... You have a look through the meeting or agenda report, which probably gives you a bit more of a... Well, not probably. It would certainly give you a bit more of an update as to where they're at.

Terry Li
Oh, you mean you sent it to me already?

Ted Middleton
Yeah. I sent it to you by... Hang on. I'm pretty sure it was email. Yeah. Saturday the 29th. I sent it to you by email. There's a, you know, a... Oh, it was the 2019.

Terry Li
Yeah, I see it now. I didn't...oh yeah, I'm not sure I didn't get it. But yeah, it probably went to some of my...yeah, I'm sorry.

Ted Middleton
Ned Strauss, you're writing a board report.

Terry Li
I'm sorry, I just see it now. Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay.

Ted Middleton
Well, look, we can talk a bit now, but the reality is that that should help you quite a bit with knowing where we're at rather than me trying to explain it to you.

Terry Li
Okay.

Ted Middleton
Yep. And that was the up to date as a, you know, that was the meeting that was last week. So when they when they report on that they're supposed to report on the first quarter of the year which is you know from July through to September, but the reality is of course what happens is you know a lot of post Period reporting gets in there as well. So you know because they you know By the time we have the meeting it's two months after the end of the quarter

Terry Li
Got it. Yeah, I just looked at it. It's a PDF and thank you for sending it to me.

Ted Middleton
Okay. Well, look, we'll have a bit of a talk now, but that's worth you looking at in some detail to get an idea where they're at, what they're doing. so

Terry Li
Yeah, software related and relevant to...

Ted Middleton
Now, one of the things, and you'll get it from that report, one of the things that is a bit of a handbrake at the moment is that starting today, they've got a major installation going on with the software. When I say installation, a major release, which is a very substantial change. For the for the users. So there's a lot of work going on and they started now It's supposed to be finished before we finish at Christmas. We finish on the 8th of December and So it'll be very difficult to get together with Tom Between now and then even for me, and I mean I don't want to interrupt them because Cheryl's fine She doesn't get too involved in that, but I But Tom, it would be very difficult to pull him out because I know that, you know, we've been through these major changes before. This one's, technically it's not as big a change as we've done before, but the operators, it's a radical change because everybody in the company is affected. Whereas, for example, the biggest change we made, we did it about 18 months ago, and it enormous and when it was we went from sort of let's say 45 percent of the new was... system up to 80 percent in a single change but it only affected it didn't affect everybody in the company because not everybody uses the accounting software I'd say maybe 55 to 60 percent of the people do whereas the changes that are being made now everybody uses it so and you know when the changes are It's interesting, the new system will, when everybody's used to it, be much easier. But because it's new, it's not easier. You know, everybody's used to doing things the old way. I don't know what you fd, but whenever I get a new phone, I hate it. Because I've gotten used to doing things the old phone way.

Terry Li
Can I ask you how many users are actually using the entire system?

Ted Middleton
Well, the Stratus software, I'm going to guess 120 to 130, about 150 people. Not everybody uses it. And Yeah, and there'd be 100 sort of, let's say, pretty well continuous users, maybe 20 or so that use it less often. It's pretty hard for me to tell. I'm just trying to think. Yeah, the numbers would be somewhere like that. Fortunately, almost all of them, the regular users, are in the main office. There is a branch office where some of them are, but it's only a relatively small number.

Terry Li
Okay.

Ted Middleton
So just to give you a heads up on that, that's all. This is, you know, I mean, one thing I'm almost embarrassed, you've obviously done a lot of research on this and I really commend your research. Although, as I did mention to you in the message I said, is, well, sometimes what happens is, Obviously, not everything you get on the internet is accurate, nor is it up to date. And just for a bit of background on our company, and you would have got this in your research, I think, about early last year, sort of 18 months ago, a bit over 18 months ago, we came in for a spate of very bad publicity. And what happens, if I wind back a bit further, Our industry, the strata industry in Australia, until the beginning of last year was more or less invisible. Most people just didn't even know it existed. And if they did know it existed, they didn't even know what we did, which was fine with us. We'd grown to an enormous extent in this industry and I want to say we dominated the industry. We were certainly in the largest state in New South Wales. We are the largest single state operator. And there are some other big companies out there. Those that are there have been in the business a lot longer than we have. You know, some of them started in the 70s, early 80s, where, you know, we started in 1996. And we're going to be talking about it. So, the thing we, what we did start to do, we realised a long time ago that the future in our industry wasn't just in being in it, but in servicing it, in being a supplier to the industry. So, we started to vertically integrate it. our businesses. And I think you've made mention of that. The software came about, and I can't remember how much I've told this stuff. I'm just repeating what I said before. I apologise, but I've forgotten what I told you. But we got into it almost, not almost, we got into it by accident. We had a proprietary software system when we first started in 1996. It was changed just before the year 2000 because the operators panicked. They thought maybe it mightn't survive the Y2K. Everything did, including that. But we stayed with the same proprietary system. And then along the way, the realization was that if we were going to make any headway, we had to have something that would do what we wanted to do our way. Do it differently, because all along the philosophy of our business wasn't to do what everybody else was doing, but to do it differently. You know, it's just we think, I mean, I think that most of our industry, even to this day, are asleep at the wheel. They haven't got a clue what's going on. They just get blown along by the breeze. So we commissioned, along with it. That was around 2006, 2007. They worked out a cost for it which turned out to be wildly underestimated what it was going to cost to build. So from about 2009 onwards, we had to support them financially to keep building the software. Eventually, the other operators, other users that contributed to this, most of them dropped off. There was a couple still hung in there. One of them was the Western Australian company, Richardson. And there were a couple of others, one in Melbourne and one elsewhere in East Wales. So, such that at around 2011, and again, I'm being a bit, it doesn't matter, the dates aren't important. We actually started to use the software, you know, we were using it sort of in parallel to our other systems. And then it came to us, and by which time we'd lent them a lot of money. We had a mortgage as a result of lending in that money. We had a mortgage over the software and over their company. Then it came to us that they were trying to sell the software from underneath us. So we foreclosed on the mortgage. It was a fairly, let's say, testing time because we didn't really know what was going to happen. Software is not like a piece of property. You know, it's very portable, as you well know. And And we were fortunate, you know, having foreclosed on the mortgage, on the company, all of the employees, there were only four or five, I think, employees elected to come with us. You know, they saw us as they realised we were the major financial backer of the business. and they were concerned about their own financial well-being. People bugged with their pockets eventually, didn't they? So they all came over. Okay, we took it over in 2011. Yeah. And, of course, then we discovered just how much hadn't been done. We persisted with it. By 2013, we had essentially fully integrated into that software we we'd gotten rid of the original software but it was still it was still limping along and we was you 2013, know obviously still developing it a couple of years later maybe 2015 it was probably but it had probably matured it reached the sort of maybe if not the developmental limits, it was doing everything we wanted to do. In 2016, we, of course, concluded that this software platform that it was on just could not be expanded. I mean, it wouldn't work in the second, well, the third decade of the 21st century and on. So we had to rebuild it completely, start from scratch with it, with a new suite of software. I won't take you through the whole story, but, you know, during all of this, there were people coming and going. I mean, not everybody. I think only of the original five employees of the company we took over, three were still with us. Right now, there's only one. And but I. Yeah, so we started on that new platform. And that, again, excuse my lack of technical competency, but that was obviously going to be cloud based, which the new system is. But the architect of that system then said, look, it's possible for us to build a system, operate the systems in parallel. You'll understand, I suppose, technically how that's possible. So from a user's perspective, the user looks at one system, but they're actually using two. Some of it's the new system in the cloud, some of it's the old system. Well, of course, gradually we're weaning our way off the old system. And now with, say, the changes that are happening this month, I'm going to say that we'd be 85% operating in the new system. Everything, though, even though the old system was never designed to operate in the cloud, it has migrated there. It had to for practical purposes. And... So the objective that you mentioned and you'll see in the board report is that the old system will be virtually put to bed by the end of next year. When I say virtually, there are still little elements of it. They're only very small, but, you know, this developed over a long period of time, and it's going to take a year or more to replicate all of them. But they're low, you know, they're very low priority items. I mean, if we didn't have them, it would just be an irritation rather than anything catastrophic. So nominally the end of next year is the point at which we switch it off, but in fact it'll still be running in the background. And Richardson's, the company in Western Australia, again one of the initial investors in changing this to SMP. The old system is called SMP, used to be called Strata Manager Pro, we just called it SMP. The new system is called Strataspace. So when you're reading the words, you'll understand what the difference is. SNP is the thing that's quietly been put to bed. And so right now we're on track to conclude the expected rollover by the end of next year. Richardson's are still operating on what is mostly the original SMP platform. What they're using of the Strataspace platform is only relatively small. I think I said to you in the email I sent, they're probably five years behind us. It's not really five years. It took us five years to get there. For them, it would probably be a lot quicker because we've already ironed out the wrinkles and they've got a much, much smaller operation than we've got. So, I mean, we've got around 50,000 Strata clients. I think they've got like 7 or 8,000, you know. So it's all the pain and suffering we've been through. It would be minuscule by comparison. So they're run, but where they're at is pretty much They're happy with what they've got. I think the problem is even taking on the parts of strata space that they have taken on. They've had a bit of indigestion with it. They've found that, you know, it's all very well. It works wonderfully when everybody knows what they're doing. But getting people to understand what they're doing is another matter.

Terry Li
I have a question about like when you were saying that there was just a couple of hundreds of users, but that's perplexing to me because I understand you have a lot of like you have a lot of properties and under management. Aren't those property owners part of the user group?

Ted Middleton
They only have access to a well. They do have that online access, but basically it's a look-see access. And they get that through a mobile app, which dominates the external users' access. But they also have like a desktop access as well, which is basically a copy of the mobile app. It just, in fact, it looks exactly the same as the bigger screen. But it operates on a different platform apparently. So in that case, yes, the numbers go into thousands. But they don't have any data input. When I say access, they've got access to the system. They can see things. They can see a lot of things. But there's no input from them other than, you know, I think they're slowly being given opportunities to make changes. But obviously there's limits as to what, you know, what you can do, for example, you know, with any system, like you make an airline booking, you can go and look at the booking, but you can't change it online. what you can do. Or maybe you can't. No, you can cancel it. But there are very, very, I mean, we work in a very tight regulatory environment. And I'll come back to that because I've been a... diverged quite a bit telling you about the history of the software itself and where we're at with it. Now our longer objective, our primary objective is to get the thing working the way we want it. Of course there's a wish list that goes out the door and around the corner about things we want to do. Already the software is doing It's a infinitely more than any other system on the market. You could replicate some of the things we do, but you'd need multiple systems. It wouldn't be an integrated system. You'd be doing one thing on one system and the data wouldn't be getting into the other one. You could do it, but it'd be very sticky. And apparently some people do. It's a very sticky process. Whereas ours is a wholly integrated system. Like, for example, our document management system is part of the management system. Virtually every other system that uses document management just attaches to a separate document management system. You know, press this button, that window opens, that's a different system. Ours is wholly integrated, which allows us to do a lot of things, like, for example, the visibility, client visibility. If they want to look at documents on the screen, either on their phone or on a computer, then they've got the kind of access that it just would not be possible for anybody else. That's just one of the things, but there's a bunch of other things. So our objective is to get that obviously as functioning as efficiently as we can, doing most of the things we wanted to do. Obviously, development will go on in perpetuity. It'll never end. It'll be like painting the Harbour Bridge, they say. You can start at one end and go to the other, and then as soon as you're at the other end, you need to start again. So it's going to be like that. The next once we've completed take the end of next year, the next major move is to then making it possible, enable it for software as a service. And Richardson's will be, as you've alluded, our first foray there. the fact is that they're already part of the way. And they're happy to go with us. But I think, you know, the last little, what I read in the board report, and I heard Tom say, they were, you know, they were choked up a bit by what they had to do. It's all shit, you know, there's a lot going on here. We need time to absorb this. And not everybody, including Richardson's, are quite as dynamic in the sense of, leading with their chins in the field of software development. Look, we've made a habit out of just everything we can do. We automate as much as we possibly can. The same, and you'll read about it with our foray into AI. Right now, it's very, very baby steps because we know, because we already use AI. We also know its limitations apart from what it can do. And I'll give you an example. One of our companies is a law firm. And much to my intense annoyance, the general manager of the law firm prepared her board report entirely using ChatGTP. And I wasted the, you know, normally I would have gone through that board report in about, I'd say, three hours, three or four hours. Okay. I wasted an entire Saturday morning trying to get through the financial component where the analysis was just fucking gobbledygook. I mean, some of it made sense, but then it very quickly delved off into nonsense. But it took me a while to work out that this wasn't written by a person. So I read it through. I've got a Grammarly subscription. That's the program that universities use to check on plagiarism. And of course, it came in at 88% produced by AI. And honestly, 50% of that 88% was just garbage. And it's not because, you know, it was very well presented, beautiful graphs and charts and everything else, but they were meaningless. And it's the sort of thing you'd expect a not very good first-year accounting student to produce. And one that wasn't really expecting to have a big career in the field, you know. I mean, I've been, you know, I've been, I've been doing this for almost 60 years. There's not, you know, I think, you know, especially in my days when I was a lot better, analysis was one of my foretakes. And, you know, and I looking at this, this is rubbish. Maybe it would pass Master with somebody who knew a little bit about it, but not somebody who knows just about all there is to know. And then going, where did this come from? Anyway, that's, so let me tell you, she got the biggest kick in the ass when the meeting came. And then to add insult to injury, she lied and said, no, no, I didn't use chat GDP or I didn't. Yeah. Well, anyway, that's another story. But so. Yeah, we're familiar with it. But for our own use, we're going into it. And one of our, the guy who's, you'll hear the name Epi Nito. Epi Nito is our IT administrator. Interestingly, Epi came to us on, what was the name of the visa? Anyway. He's Brazilian. And when he first started working for us, he was, I think he finished his studies, but he was working for another company and then he came to work for us. They didn't want to keep engaging him. So we took over his visa. We took over as his visa sponsors. And I'm talking now, this is around... maybe 10 or 11 years ago. And so he was with us for a couple of years until he got permanent residency. And then he went and worked for somebody else, much to our annoyance, because we really thought he was good. And after a while, he came back and worked for us again. He did it again. Well, you'd think we would like this for punishment, but this time he's on an ironclad contract. He's a very, very clever operator, but he's a bit sort of... I don't know. They all like him. They think he's great. I just look at his history and worry about him. But anyway, the point is he's on an ironclad contract. He's the one leading our AI charge. He went off one of his, one of the things he did, he went off and did a master's in AI tech or something. I don't know exactly what he did. So he's leading our AI, let's say, foray. But if you read a little bit, there's not a lot in there about it, but you really look, they've got plans for how to do it, but it's very, very baby steps. We want to see how this goes, use it only internally before we let it loose on the client base. And that may, you know, I mean, the truth is, Knowing how things go in software, that could even be years away. You know, I give it up. When we started on Strata Space 2016, the original estimate was four years. Well, right now, we're expecting it might be finished at the end of next year. So that went from four years to 12 years. And from, you know, maybe, I don't know, I forget what the budget was back then, but probably a few million dollars. And, you know, what we've already spent on it, you know, it makes that, you know, this is like a government project, you know, the whole budget. But mind you, having said that, And I did say as much at the board meeting, what we're doing today, even, we couldn't have even imagined 10 years ago. So it wasn't that we didn't plan on doing it. We couldn't have even imagined it because, you know, the tech just wasn't there. And if it was, it was like pipe dream stuff. Now, of course, we're doing it. Now, the other big change we had to make when we moved into the new building, which happened in over a year ago now, I think it happened in October last year, everything had to go up to the cloud before we moved because we weren't going to move any old servers or anything else like that. We were just going to be junked shortly anyway. That was also, it didn't go especially smoothly because some of the systems we had had to just, well, didn't work very well in the cloud. And probably it's been until, yeah, pretty recently that we finally lined all those problems out. You know, that took quite a while to digest. Things that were working beautifully when they went up to the cloud, you know, they just, well, they didn't work beautifully or at all. You've probably heard all this before, but it's... But, you know, where we are, I think it's a pretty good place, but shit, it's been painful getting there and expensive. Now, going back to what I said earlier about our rough publicity. early last year, the local ABC, it's like Canada's CBC. The trouble is the ABC here, it's just a mouthfeet for the political left. And I'm talking about the radical political left. They did a hit job on us. And that's what it was. They came up with a former employer who we checked. And the former employee was a woman who was in a relationship for some time, a failed relationship with one of our associate directors. and So she hated us. She hated the company. She hated the associate, hated everybody. So she was their still pigeon, if you like, the one blowing the whistle. Well, they come up with a hit piece on a television program. That was, look, I thought that would blow over in a few months, and it really did. And... Most of the heat did blow over in a few months. But of course, it attracted the attention of the regulators, because they were alleging all, you know, they made all sorts of allegations about wrongdoing. So we had to commit ourselves to an audit done by an independent auditor appointed by the Office of Fair Trading, who's the regulator that oversees our business operations. And that audit took place, it took from the middle of last year to through to the end of last year before the audit was completed, at incredible expense. We paid a large part of it, and then the opposite of fair trading paid for the rest. When the audit report came out, I don't know whether you've ever read audit reports. None of them are ever complimentary. They'll never say things like, you're doing a great job. They just tell you everything you're doing wrong. Now, the audit report wasn't too bad. I mean... If you sort of cut through, if you read it properly, the trouble is it goes for 200 pages. So it's not something, you know, and there was what they call the audit report. And then there was an executive report, which is four pages, which plucked out all the nasty things. And so. But when you read through it, the realisation is that it wasn't too bad. You know, it was, yeah, sure, there were some things in there we probably could have done better, and there were some things we certainly could have done, probably could have, you know, would be better if we hadn't done it all. But they weren't, none of them were hanging offences. And when that order of Ford landed on the office of AirTrading, they'd be, oh, yes, look, there's all these things they've done wrong and we're going to be doing something about it. Well, the reality is, There was nothing there that was an offence. And it was very, that was very embarrassing, first of all, for the political, political, in the political spectrum that have been pushing this and saying, look, get them, get them, get them, you know, and we were a high profile target. And so the Office of Bear Trading said, well, we're not happy with the audit report. We're going to launch our own investigation. Well, all I can say to you is that you've never seen a Monty Python movie? Look it up, Monty Python. To say it was amateurish would be slanderous to amateurs. Honestly, it's It's so spectacularly incompetent what they've been doing. But of course, the problem is it's hanging around our heads and it's created a situation where we've had to do things just to maintain, you know, not just transparency and compliance, but to obviously maintain it, you know, to go over the top and look, you know, like, outrageously so. So it's been costly to do that. Like, this inspection, I mean, when it's audit rather, no, they don't call it an audit, they call it an investigation. You know, it sounds better, it sounds better. And right now, we've got no idea what's happening with it. I mean, it just seems to have been pushed down the line to a very low level of the department. It's sitting on somebody's desk and whatever they've got a career there, it'll probably stay on their desk because it's the only thing they've got to live for. So we don't really know what's going to happen there. So a lot of things we've had to do with the software in the last 15 months, particularly certainly this year, is to tweak the visibility of our compliance. And that's why many of the things now that our client base can see There's no real need for us to do that, but it gives the appearance. It's the old story, you've probably heard it before. The more you give people, the more information you give people, the less they read. So if you want somebody not to take any notice of something, just give them too much information. And so we haven't done that deliberately because the regulators like that, the more the more shit they've got, that's the more, you know, they're all visible. So just you know, you would have I'm sure you would have come across this in the net. I mean, it's impossible to do any research on it and not come up with the ABC story and the McGraw-Nickel audit and all that sort of business. But that's the back story to it. That's how it came about. And, you know, it's been financially painful and operationally painful for us. And I mean, it's not threatening. It's hardly threatening for the viability of the business, but still it's cost us millions of dollars to deal with. And it's cost us a lot of money in the art to, and we've got like a full time business. What's he? I forget what the name is. The guys are compliance and something or other manager. His whole job is just making sure that everything we do is compliant with every regulation and every new regulation and every regulation that ever existed. and the risk and compliance manager his name is. And so, I mean, there's just, you know, a guy probably gets 150 grand a year, I'm not sure. But it's, so that's somewhere, And. that's where we're at as a business. As to what you could contribute, The only people you can, what I was going to do, I wanted to talk to you first, but maybe if you talk to you again after you've read these and studied these board report, I'll hand on the documents you sent me. Not all of them. I'm just looking at, can I just look now? Hang on. I've got a list. I've got them up here. Oh, shit. I did have them up. Yeah. the work visa pathway, technical competencies and augmented development, AI augmented development. Yeah. I was going to send that. The next route of research I wasn't going to, partly because there's a lot of Just the basic errors in there. Not it. You'll get, I know how you're going to get the errors. You just get a net research, but not knowing enough about the company. Um, so I, probably not germane to what you'd be doing anyway. So, um, I, um, I can pass this on to Cheryl, but I want it, I want you to, I want you to have a look at that first and you might want to make some amendments to that. I don't know. Um, as a result.

Terry Li
Yes, I would like to.

Ted Middleton
um yeah but it's no street i don't think the not so much the work visa but the um the technical competencies the augmented development and um the research you didn't worry about that's you know that's you know i've read that yeah good i that's why i said i truly eric i admire your courage you can put a lot of work into this um and i'm almost embarrassed i thought oh you know look

Terry Li
Yeah, it's fine. It's the least I can do because I'm interested in, just not from a job seeking point of view, I truly love this opportunity just to know what you've been from your career wise. Just the opportunity here to just talk to you about what you've been doing, like how your company is. I think it's a perfect opportunity. Even this doesn't pan out. So I perfectly enjoy this.

Well, you know, and just the one about the work visa pathway summary, it was the subclass 482, the visa 482, that Epi was originally engaged on. And also, one of the other employees, what was her name? Doesn't matter. And he didn't come to us with the software, but the girl who was one of the coders, she Epi... was Iranian. And anyway, she was here on a visit. We picked up her sponsorship when we took over the company. And in Epi's case, he was our IT and AI guy. He came to us again from another company, but we picked up the sponsorship and the 482. So I'm familiar with the 482. And interestingly, this very morning, I got an email from the law company, Integrated Legal, who did all the legal work for us, did all the migration legal work for us. And what they just... It was just by coincidence. I would have just deleted it normally, but where the fuck is it? Oh, okay. Inbox will help. Yeah, navigating the 482 visa. It was... Yeah, apparently there's some complexities now that the government has introduced to the 482 visa that may or may not impact your interests, I'm not sure. But I know that it's dealing with immigration in Australia and I've got a first-hand experience of this right now because your mum's, before she comes back to Australia, has to have a resident return visa. She's got residency because she's been out for so long, she needs a resident return visa. I filled in the application form online on Saturday, but then couldn't upload any of the supporting documents, and I still can't upload them today. And as I check online, apparently there's, you know, there could be all manner of reasons for that. But it's one of the reasons why up until now, all the visa work that had been done on your mum's visa was done by this legal firm, Integrate Legal. But I thought, well, the resident return visa is much simpler. I mean, it's a bloody form filling and, you know, you've got to update it with a few documents. But it hasn't been easy at all. I may end up giving up and getting the lawyers to do it anyway. I can't upload the documents. And you can't, the problem with the government, you can't talk to anybody. all you can do is fill in the form that says I've got a problem with this you know by the time somebody even looks at the form you know you've either died of old age or you know the problem's been resolved anyway so well but that's um yeah what i'll do i'll just sit on this can you have a look at that when you have just let me know when you're free and we'll talk again and then i could pass this on to cheryl but the problem will be before christmas anyway cheryl may be able to talk to you if there's any value but it but uh tom who's crucial all this probably won't because for reasons i've already said he's really going to be hamstrung now between now and when we close on the 18th of December because it's just going to be a you know it's a very very busy time for them with this big change in the and you'll you'll see what You'll see what's in the report, you know, although I think they've downplayed it this off because I know exactly what happens with these things. You know, it doesn't matter how much training you give people, you know, as soon as they look, they're staring at a screen, somebody hit the keyboard, something different happens, you know. You know, 120 people, hey, there's a problem here, you know.

Terry Li
Yeah, so I guess that's totally fine. I believe it's a work in progress. And I know it's not no longer a time sensitive manner because I am not looking to like immediately change pace or whatever. Yeah, so it's fine.

Ted Middleton
You can see with the 482 visa, I mean, I don't know how long. Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at it. No, I've got no idea. Whatever indications they put on the government website, I don't believe it because, you know, the lawyers, I must admit that, the integrated lawyers have been very efficient, although the cost of bond, they've been very efficient in the past, certainly with your mum's visa. So anyway, that's...

Terry Li
Yeah, and also I do believe that because from my role, my commitment to coming to Australia is a sign that I'm willing to commit. But I don't think it's really necessary to arrange it right from the start.

Ted Middleton
Yeah. A lot of our coding is done in Manila. And also, a lot of our administrative work is done in Manila as well. And just so you're clear about the relationship with that company, that was one of the things that came in for a lot of caning from the ABC report, that we had this relationship. And that's right, we didn't disclose it. But we don't have a direct relationship with the company. Well, It's actually through the family of one of our directors. And because that was never disclosed, that was made of, you know. Well, in fact, the folly of it all is that that company, they do no client-facing work at all. All the work that they do is back office. And the reason we originally started using them was because we knew that a lot of the work that they were doing would ultimately be taken over by software. And it was just much easier to have an offshore operation that we could slowly just shut down. trying to fire people in Australia have been working with you for a few years and say, oh, well, your job's been taken over by software. All that shit. You need to buy them a house to get rid of them, you know. But as it turns out, they're doing such a good job. They've been doing the work for probably, I'm guessing, 15 years now. They've been up there. They're actually doing such a good job that even though much of the work they used to do has now been taken over software, we've given them other, you know, there's been other work. But... I mean, look, AI software, it's going to do a lot of our work, but it's hard to imagine a time when we won't need any people at all. It's just, you know, like it's unimaginable. But I do imagine a lot more work being done by, and not just AI, but even smart software. And this is, I don't know, you know, it's a lot of work. You know, I'm sure there's a lot of fake AI around. I mean, I've heard people say that some of the things our software is doing, oh, they're using AI. Well, we're not. You know, it's just clever software, you know? And I'm sure you understand that. I mean, in the end, AI's... Like that's all it is isn't it? It's clever software. Yeah, it's a

Terry Li
efficiency It's just efficiency accelerator You can help it doesn't things a bit more efficient

Ted Middleton
It's a you know very very very, you know a very, very powerful probability calculator, but it doesn't do any thinking. And so, you know, there's nobody, there's no, you know, sort of hardware there going, what do we do next, you know? Yeah, it's a very, very powerful, and that's my words, probability calculator. But it's beyond that, the actual process of intelligence, the way we understand it, doesn't happen at all. And, you know, and this fucking, you haven't got time, it doesn't matter, you probably wouldn't understand it anyway. This bloody... idiotic board report that I got from the from especially the accounting part of it you know which was so infuriated me because it's something I will know I understand it like you know I said I've been doing it for nearly 60 years and when I see this and go it's interesting it reads very well you know like it reads well but it's just garbage very entertaining garbage anyway so I've taken up a lot of your time so have a look at that yeah have a look at that yeah and those three documents not so much the visa pathway because that's the technical companies of the augmented development you might want to have a little thinking about that and you've got a better background from the horse's mouth of the company itself apart from what you might get on the internet And it's, but you know, I say to you, you know, we, our software is a country mile ahead of anything else that's on the, in our industry. And it is, because it's the only management software actually created by a management company. The other software, the big players, one of them is owned by a bank. The other one's essentially a banking operation. It's a big accounting operation. And the third one, Rockin, is they provide as a real estate software, but Strata was never really a big part of their operation. It's become bigger. And again, you know, our industry is a big part of it. Until the beginning of last year, pretty much nobody knew our industry even existed. It's just one of those businesses that operated in the background and nobody knew anything about it. Now, all of a sudden, the spotlight's been on us and we're the new robber barons, apparently. Yeah. So anyway, you got the idea? So just let me know when you've had a comment to digest that and maybe review it and I can send it on to Cheryl. So, yeah. But as I said, getting together with Tom, probably not until next year. And then, um, And then of course, you can do everything like we're doing now. Do it online.

Terry Li
So I guess it's fine. I'll take my time. I'll take my time to absorb the information and come up with some preliminary ideas first. I guess the eventual goal, of course, is to get through two... I would say gatekeepers. There are two gatekeepers. First is Cheryl, the other one is Tom. But I think eventually it very much hangs on, hangs on in the balance of me knowing whatever that's got to be.

Ted Middleton
Once you've got a clear idea, you know, what we're doing and, you know, well, the program and how we're going. And I have to say that you'll get from the board report. They're doing pretty well. They apparently put on, I didn't even know it until I saw the board report, they put on eight new people in the last quarter. So they had been struggling getting the right talent. You know, they're not. I suppose in the coding area, there's all different parts of it. And they managed to happen upon eight new ones in over a period of a couple of months, apparently. So that must have been in between, or between the end of the last financial year, between July and now. So, you know, anyway, Good to talk to you. It's about time for me to call your mum too. I told her a bit about what we talked about early on, anyway, but no details. And with this, I haven't mentioned anything. Look, you know, There's probably nothing I can tell you that you don't already know about your mum. You know, I love her with a passion, but she gets ideas. She's a real Chinese tiger mum, and she gets ideas about everything to do with her family. She gets very offended when people don't take any notice of her, and of course that happens all the time. And she says to me, I don't understand how you have such a wonderful relationship with your daughters. I said, because I keep my mouth shut. I think I told you that when we were with, you know. and was it August?

Terry Li
Yep yeah she told me about like how's everything and whenever you told her something she told me hey don't worry like Ted's gonna talk to you about it and she's she's definitely like worry about how I see perceive things but yeah I know both of you and you have nothing but the best of heart for my well-being and my anything like I truly appreciate

Ted Middleton
it so yeah don't worry I'll try to. Anyway no I just want to let you know that you know I'm not I'm not going to be saying pretty much anything now she asked me I said hey we talked this a bit more to go yeah yeah I just brush over it. No problem. Yeah. Um, and so, um, so if she does say anything to you, she's making it up.

Terry Li
Sure. No problem. Yeah. Yeah.

Ted Middleton
She's got another project on a plate right now. So, you know, that should keep her occupied for a while.

Terry Li
Right. Okay. Okay. You have a good day. Yep. Bye. - Love you. - Bye. ご視聴ありがとうございました。
