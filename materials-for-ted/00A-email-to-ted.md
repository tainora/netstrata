# Follow-Up Email to Ted Middleton

Hi Ted,

Thanks for taking the time to call on November 30 and for sending Tom Bacani's Q3 Board Report. The Board Report and your context notes were invaluable for understanding where Strata Space development actually stands.

## Understanding Corrections

You were right that the research document (now Doc 03) had basic errors from internet research. I've since revised it along with the technical competencies (Doc 01) and AI methodology (Doc 02) documents based on our conversation. Key corrections include:

- Timeline now reflects December 2025 and July 2026 milestones (not vague "end-2026")
- Richardson framing corrected (stable adoption, not urgent migration blocker)
- AI positioning clarified (development tooling, not competing with Epi's business automation work)
- Name spellings fixed (Tom Bacani, Epi Neto)

## Additional Material for Tom

I've also prepared a document on development philosophy (now Doc 04) that might interest Tom specifically. It covers iterative release practices with evidence from my GitHub history—42 architecture decision records, 64 releases in 9 days during a recent sprint, and how semantic versioning can support 3 parallel squads coordinating toward the July 2026 milestone.

The revised documents are ready for whenever makes sense to share with Cheryl or Tom.

Best,
Terry
