# Follow-Up Email to Ted Middleton

Hi Ted,

Thanks for taking the time to call on November 30 and for sending Tom Bacani's Q3 Board Report. The Board Report and your context notes were invaluable for understanding where Strata Space development actually stands.

## Understanding Corrections

You were right that the research document (04) had basic errors from internet research. I've since revised it along with the technical competencies (01) and AI methodology (02) documents based on our conversation. Key corrections include:

- Timeline now reflects December 2025 and July 2026 milestones (not vague "end-2026")
- Richardson framing corrected (stable adoption, not urgent migration blocker)
- AI positioning clarified (development tooling, not competing with Epi's business automation work)
- Name spellings fixed (Tom Bacani, Epi Neto)

The revised documents are ready for whenever makes sense to share with Cheryl or Tom.

Best,
Terry
