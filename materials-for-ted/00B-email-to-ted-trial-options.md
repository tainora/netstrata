# Follow-Up Email to Ted Middleton — Trial Engagement Options

_January 2026_

---

Hi Ted,

Following our earlier conversations, I wanted to present some **zero-risk options** for Netstrata to evaluate my potential contribution before any employment commitment. These arrangements are common in the tech industry—companies like Linear, Automattic (WordPress), and Gumroad use similar approaches to reduce hiring risk.

I'm conscious that my current toolchain may differ from what Tom's team uses, and I'm prepared to invest my own time proving fit before Netstrata incurs any cost or obligation.

## Option A: No-Cost Pilot Project (Recommended)

**What I Offer:**

- 5 hours per week of development work
- Up to 6 months duration
- Focused on a specific, scoped deliverable agreed with Tom
- Zero cost to Netstrata

**Perks for Netstrata:**

- **Risk-free evaluation**: See actual output before any hiring decision
- **No visa sponsorship cost** during trial period
- **No salary commitment** until proven value
- **Flexibility to end anytime** with no obligation
- **Real deliverables**: Documentation, testing, automation—whatever supports July 2026 milestone

This follows the "pro bono trial engagement" model where I absorb the cost of proving fit, rather than Netstrata paying for a work trial.

## Option B: Free Claude Code Training for Tom's Team

**What I Offer:**

- Online training sessions on [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding assistant)
- Access to my self-developed screening materials: [Claude Code VA Assessment](https://terrylica.github.io/bruntwork-claude-screening/)
  - 4 structured quizzes (46 questions total)
  - Covers effective prompting, safety, agentic architecture, and hooks
  - Professional assessment format with answer explanations
- Training on the [cc-skills plugin marketplace](https://github.com/terrylica/cc-skills) (18 plugins, 100+ reusable skills)

**Perks for Netstrata:**

- **Immediate productivity boost**: Team learns AI-augmented development without external training costs
- **Battle-tested materials**: Already used for contractor screening
- **No vendor lock-in**: Claude Code is Anthropic's official tool, not proprietary
- **Accelerate July 2026**: AI coding agents can compress weeks of work into days
- **Zero cost**: Training provided free as demonstration of my teaching capability

This positions Netstrata ahead of competitors who haven't adopted AI development practices yet.

## Option C: Combined Approach

**What I Offer:**

- Start with **Option B** (training) to demonstrate immediate value
- Transition to **Option A** (pilot project) once team sees benefit
- Natural progression toward employment discussion if results warrant

**Perks for Netstrata:**

- **Lowest commitment path**: Training has zero ongoing obligation
- **Proof before investment**: See teaching quality before considering development work
- **Team buy-in**: Tom's developers experience AI tooling firsthand before any staffing decision

## Why I'm Offering This

The tech industry uses "paid work trials" (typically 2-5 days) to reduce hiring risk. I'm offering something more generous: **6 months of no-cost contribution** because:

1. I'm confident the value will be evident
2. I understand Netstrata's conservative approach to technology adoption (learned from the board report AI discussion)
3. I want to prove fit with Tom's team before any visa/employment complexity
4. This is my final career move—I'm optimizing for the right fit, not quick employment

## Next Steps

If any of these options interest Cheryl, Tom, or other decision-makers, I'm happy to:

- Discuss scope and deliverables for a pilot project
- Schedule an introductory Claude Code training session
- Provide additional materials or references

The revised technical documents (01, 02, 04, 05) remain available—now updated to reflect that December 2025 milestone is complete and July 2026 is the next target.

Best regards,
Terry
