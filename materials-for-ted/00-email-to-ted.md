Hi Ted,

Thanks for taking the time to talk on November 4. I've been reflecting on our conversation about the three-phase opportunity and wanted to share my approach to software development that could help Netstrata accelerate toward the end-2026 completion milestone.

## Addressing AI Tool Skepticism Through Demonstration

I understand the common view that AI coding tools are proof-of-concept only. Most industry commentary—blog posts, YouTube reviews, conference talks—shares this skepticism. Many practitioners have experimented casually and concluded these tools aren't production-ready.

This skepticism is reasonable given surface-level usage. However, thousands of hours of production experience reveal different patterns: these tools ARE ready for professional software development when integrated systematically.

Rather than advocate based on theory, I'd welcome the opportunity to demonstrate AI-augmented workflows to Tom Bakani's team during Phase 1 work. You can assess value based on measurable results—time savings, code quality improvements, velocity gains on real Netstrata challenges.

## Why Early Adoption Creates Competitive Advantage

Modern AI coding agents have become general-purpose power tools in software engineering. Once the learning investment is made, they can be applied systematically across code review, testing, refactoring, documentation, and routine development tasks.

The critical insight: **The opportunity cost of NOT adopting while these tools are maturing is now greater than the risk of premature adoption.**

**Competitive Window for Netstrata**: Strata software competitors (Strata Master, :Different, external vendors) are unlikely to be using these practices yet. Industry-wide skepticism means early adopters gain 12-24 months of velocity advantage. By the time consensus shifts to "production-ready," Netstrata is already ahead.

**Your Software Investment**: The $12-14M proprietary software represents a decade of encoded NSW regulatory knowledge. AI-assisted development can help protect this investment through systematic code review, comprehensive testing, and quality assurance—especially critical as you approach the end-2026 completion deadline.

Classic software principles (KISS, YAGNI) still apply to system design and architecture. But they don't forbid using powerful tools on routine tasks. The relevant question for each workflow: does the benefit exceed the cost? For most development work—especially under deadline pressure—the answer is consistently yes.

## The Three-Phase Opportunity

**Phase 1 (Priority through 2026):** Complete the proprietary software

- Working with Tom Bakani's team on final development
- Happy to demonstrate AI-augmented workflows—team can assess whether these approaches add value for Netstrata's priorities
- Supporting Andrew Tunks' operational efficiency mandate
- Hitting the end-2026 completion milestone

**Phase 2 (Current blocker):** Get ready for Western Australia migration

- You mentioned the WA customer is "hell-bent" to migrate but "we're not ready yet"
- Building migration infrastructure, validation frameworks, rollback mechanisms
- Creating training materials and support systems
- AI-assisted documentation generation and testing can accelerate readiness

**Phase 3 (Post-2026):** Broader external offering to non-NSW markets

- Your "give it away with strings" freemium strategy
- Offering cut-down version to markets outside your competitive zone
- Protecting NSW competitive advantage while enabling strategic expansion

I initially focused too much on Phase 3 when Phases 1-2 are immediate priorities. **My interest is contributing across all three phases**, starting with software completion and demonstrating what modern development practices can deliver.

## The Three Obstacles

1. **Work visa sponsorship** - Researched Subclass 482 pathway. Employer costs ~AUD $3K-$4K, 2-4 month timeline. Details attached.

2. **Age/timeline** - Treating this as final career move. The phased approach (2026 completion → WA migration → broader rollout) aligns with long-term commitment.

3. **Family relocation** - Mentally prepared for 2-3 years of family separation while kids finish university. Not ideal, but necessary if this is the right long-term fit.

## On Mum's Wishes

I don't want that to be part of your calculation—this should be about capability and business fit.

## Next Steps

I'm attaching four brief documents:

1. Technical competencies summary (2-3 pages)
2. AI-augmented development methodology details (2-3 pages)
3. Work visa pathway summary (1 page)
4. Netstrata research summary (3 pages)

When you're available after November 27, I'd appreciate an introduction to Cheryl Williams to discuss employment fit. During that conversation, I'd also welcome the chance to discuss demonstration approaches with Tom Bakani's team—letting results speak rather than making theoretical claims about capabilities.

No rush—I know you're buried in board work through month-end.

Best,
Terry
