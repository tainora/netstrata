Hi Ted,

Thanks for taking the time to talk on November 4. I've been reflecting on our conversation about the three-phase opportunity and wanted to share my approach to software development that could help Netstrata accelerate toward the end-2026 completion milestone.

## AI-Augmented Development Approach

I'd welcome the opportunity to demonstrate AI-augmented workflows to Tom Bakani's team during Phase 1 work. You can assess value based on measurable results—time savings, code quality improvements, velocity gains on real Netstrata challenges.

My AI methodology details (thousands of hours with [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) CLI, systematic workflow integration, demonstration-first approach) are in the attached document (02).

## The Three-Phase Opportunity

**Phase 1 (Priority through 2026):** Complete the proprietary software - working with Tom Bakani's team on final development, hitting the end-2026 completion milestone.

**Phase 2 (Current blocker):** Get ready for Western Australia migration - the WA customer you mentioned is "hell-bent" to migrate but "we're not ready yet." I can help build migration infrastructure, validation frameworks, and support systems.

**Phase 3 (Post-2026):** Broader external offering to non-NSW markets using your "give it away with strings" freemium strategy.

My interest is contributing across all three phases, starting with software completion. Detailed analysis of each phase and my contribution areas is in the attached research summary (04).

## The Three Obstacles

1. **Work visa sponsorship** - Researched Subclass 482 pathway. Employer costs ~AUD $3K-$4K, 2-4 month timeline. Details attached.

2. **Age/timeline** - Treating this as final career move. The phased approach (2026 completion → WA migration → broader rollout) aligns with long-term commitment.

3. **Family relocation** - Mentally prepared for 2-3 years of family separation while kids finish university. Not ideal, but necessary if this is the right long-term fit.

## On Mum's Wishes

I don't want that to be part of your calculation—this should be about capability and business fit.

## Next Steps

I'm attaching four documents:

1. Technical competencies summary (6 pages)
2. AI-augmented development methodology details (9 pages)
3. Work visa pathway summary (4 pages)
4. Netstrata research summary (9 pages)

When you're available after November 27, I'd appreciate an introduction to Cheryl Williams to discuss employment fit. During that conversation, I'd also welcome the chance to discuss demonstration approaches with Tom Bakani's team—letting results speak rather than making theoretical claims about capabilities.

No rush—I know you're buried in board work through month-end.

Best,
Terry
