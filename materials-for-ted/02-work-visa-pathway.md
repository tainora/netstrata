## Recommendation

**If Netstrata can justify AUD $141,210+ salary:**

- Use Specialist Skills stream
- Bypasses labour market testing (faster, simpler)

**If salary is AUD $100K-$130K range:**

- Use Core Skills stream with 261313 Software Engineer occupation
- Standard labour market testing (28-day ads)
- Timeline: 3-4 months
- Plan for 2-year temporary visa, reassess PR options later

## Key Insight

Work visa sponsorship requires commitment (AUD $3K-$4K costs, 2-4 month timeline, ongoing compliance). However, the pathway is **well-established, legally clear, and achievable**: software roles have strong CSOL eligibility, market salaries exceed minimums, and the process is straightforward with proper planning.
